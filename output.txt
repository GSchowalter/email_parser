Things are more-or-less fine here, I suppose.  I'm gorging myself on doughnut holes from Ukraps.  I wish the "Holiday Season" would go away already.  I do not think this is the most wonderful time of the year.

<b> Dec 17, 2005, at 8:02 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> yeah, the hollis record is the logical extension of the 'spirit of eden' and 'laughingstock.' possibly even more sparse. it's fantastic.

i do hear you about the quote-unquote most wonderful time of the year. i try not to be a scrooge about it. but mostly it's not my favorite. i hope to reclaim it someday.

i liked the monkey movie. holy smokes did they make a superconvincing huge gorilla. it's a really smart rethinking of the original - which i love too. it's not necessarily all that substantial, but i had a good time once the action started.

here's a new song i made. it's called "these windows on the world."

Bittersweetness

Not sure who the narrator of the song is.  Doesn't seem like your average guy--he has a kind of omniscience, I suppose.  I wonder if it's the same narrator as in "Kong Meets His Maker."  In fact, this song seems like a sequel to that one, but I can't pinpoint why, exactly.

<b> Dec 23, 2005, at 9:43 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> weird. pj sykes, i do believe. (sp?) good guy, in my experience. tell him i said hello.

for xmas i am having brunch at this woman's family's house in manhattan beach (i don't know where that is). she's this woman, ann white, who an old college friend introduced me to. i hung out with her for the second time yesterday. went to see a pretentious art show at the geffen museum (there were a couple of cool things, so 80% pretentious). she lives in austin. if i stopped to think about it, i would dread going over to the home of strangers on christmas.

then on xmas evening i'm going over to my new pastor's house, where they're having a short, informal worship service and then food and drinks and board games. my new church is pretty rad.

do you remember sitting in that el tamarindo restaurant at the bottom of adams morgan and talking about things -- this was several years ago now, pre-opera  -- and i was pretty freaked out and discouraged about the direction of my life, etc? well, i feel pretty good overall about being here in los angeles and attempting this thing i'm attempting -- whatever it is; ostensibly making money but cosmically something else? who knows -- but there are flashes of that feeling. as in: this could go very badly indeed. and i keep telling myself and god that the $42 in my bank account and my $12,000ish in accumulated debt are not important, and i read something that suggested my real problem is how i deal with the money i've got, but i think the most accurate assessment is that my financial concerns are a symptom of my larger issue, which is manhood and how to achieve it. all i can say for sure is this: i have not been slack, i have worked my ass off with a minimum of compromise. if i have no wealth or large achievement to show for it, it's not from lack of effort.

overall i am optimistic. it's just that everything always takes longer than anticipated, and i don't want it to. i want it to be very good Now. i think i'm a reasonable guy. so, Now seems good.

i'm doing the whirlwind week on the east coast 12/28 - 1/2. i guess that's actually five days. i'm passing thru richmond on the way to n.c. to see my sister, dunno if i'll get a chance to hang, but if i do i'll call.</br></br>

<b> Jan 14, 2006, at 5:48 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> boy, good luck with covering them. telegraph melts did a cover (instrumental) of 'anonymous cave' (i think, if i recall) as one of our first undertakings. it was cool, and we thought about trying to get bob schick to record it with us, but we never got around to making anything of it. i probably have a tape of that somewhere.

but he's so distinctive in his delivery that i can't imagine what a real singer would do with it. i encourage you to kick  my ass.

my very conservative and somewhat odd roommate in richmond for a couple years knew most of 'rictus' by heart. boy was i floored when i learned that about him.

i *hate* the john morand production on those records, but i love the records. i can't believe they toured with like COC and the like. they're way too nuanced and arty. i can't imagine 13 yr olds even knowing that band, but i'm glad. i will support mac from superchunk's support of pen rollings til my dying day. i would have killed to see them again on those reunions. i was somewhere else, i forget where.

they were one of those bands who kinda changed what i thought was possible with music. it wasn't, like, religious or whatever, but along with the bad brains and some others, i just started to think of music differently. 

what's really weird is on rictus there's this one song that is entirely played by the alter-natives, with bob singing, yet it fits seamlessly with the whole album.

btw, been meaning to impart meaningful reactions to yr disc. first and most unexpected: i never had much time for lucinda williams before, but i rewound that song about six times in the car. i can't believe i missed it before. i bought 'car wheels on a gravel road,' didn't care for it, and sold it. holy shit is yr solo on that great. i presume it's yrs and not directly covered...

again, i'm shocked how good things sound in garage band. there's a couple of odd things, but overall just sweet. a couple songs sound like you spent a lot of money on them. nice mixing too.

did you program the drums? surprisingly convincing, for the most part.
nice vinyl crackle on 'strange embrace.' i love that. i also love the guitar on this. and the tinny piano. all the elements of this come together so well. makes me jealous. the string entrance midway thru is one of the moments on this cd where i had this funny reaction that was something like: i have no idea if that works, but it's so singular that it might be brilliant. 

i think colorado girl is the obvious single. it's also the one that probably other people would cover first. the line about 'there's no such as cowboys anymore' takes it into this whole cool meta territory that's somehow linked to it also being kind of a twist on a genre song, if that makes any sense at all. OMIGOD and the synth lick here is SO retarded in this great great way -- the second of those funny reaction moments where i'm just so thrown because i never would have thought of it, yet it's kind of masterful. 

darker skies i remember from before. i love the synth on this. and the piano line. okay, but the flims here don't make sense to me. but the starkness of this song is fantastic. and the chorus lines are just so grim. yum. i'm torn which song is my favorite lyrically, but this one is a contender.

sunday afternoon needs a road movie to become the theme of. someone should get on that and spend a few million dollars to shoot the film that this begs. a real drummer will kill on this (no diss intended, it's just that... you know). 

i now need to ask: what does 'five a day' mean literally? i listened to this a bunch of times. is this a statistical average of casualties? i guess it must be, right? anyway, the bird killing bit = brutal, perfect.

length of string = whole different ballgame with headphones on. my friend chad, who recorded the GRB record, has this whole long riff about 'headphone records' and how grateful he is to his father for making him listen to beatles records using headphones, and how that affected the entire course of his life.

okay, now i need to get back to work. will probably have more and different things to say about these as they sink in over time.

re stacey:  i think i mentioned that i was up really late writing a giant response to her email. i guess it achieved its purpose. she wrote back a really nice response. i went to see her play with rose last night at some west hollywood joint and she was really sweet. she might go with me to church sunday eve and i think we're all gonna go to roscoe's chicken 'n' waffles on monday -- roscoe's being legendary, apparently. but me being too much of a honkey to know about it, apparently. 

overall i'm too exhausted to even think about having a relationship with a woman at this moment. there's this woman, lisa, who's kinda got the full-court press working me right now, but it's becoming clear that she comes with a truckload of dramatic baggage (and, hey, who doesn't?) but i'm so not up for sorting through it right now. simplicity, ease, that's what i'm up for. also being knocked out by someone. because that sure makes it easier.

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> / </b> <br><br> Hey.

Thanks so much for your thoughts about the songs.  That was very generous of you, and I appreciate it.

> "did you program the drums?"

Mostly, I play them in two parts at a time.  I separate them all into different tracks, eq each one a little, pan stuff left and right, then quantize the kick part.  I know you're not a Wilco fan, but if you ever get a chance, listen to the quality of the hi-hat 1 m 40 sec into their song "Kamera" from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  That's what I'm always trying for, and never accomplishing.  But then, I'm using fake drums and Garageband, so whatever.

> "the flims here don't make sense to me." (Darker Skies)

What's a "flim?"  I'm guessing it's the snare part in the bridge?  Interesting.

> "i now need to ask: what does 'five a day' mean literally?"

It's about nutrition.  You know, five servings of fruit, five of grain, five from the dairy group.  And so on. *

I was surprised by your reactions to the synth part in "Colorado Girl."  You mean the one in the little instrumental bridge that kinda sounds like a vibraphone?  My friend Jane (one time bass player for Eggs) demanded that I remove that.  Or do you mean the fat synth part in the last verse?  In either case, I had no idea that it would sound in any way unusual.  Likewise the string parts in the last verse of "Strange Embrace," so it's interesting to me that they come across as unexpected.  Hmmmm.  I hope they don't sound jokey, but whatever, I'm attached to them now.  By the way, I really do know a woman from Durango whose father was a cowboy.

Seriously, thanks.  

Interesting what you said about John Morand's production of that Honor Role stuff.  What do you hate about it?  If you could pick anyone from the history of rock to have replaced him, who would it have been?   (If you'd rather do paying work than spend time answering this question, I will certainly understand.)

I'm glad things improved with Stacey.  It sounds like it was resolved pretty well and pretty quickly.

As for avoiding someone with dramatic baggage, that's just plain wise.  Those folks can be friends, but maybe not so easily "partners" or "significant others" or whatever.  I should know!  Your exhaustion sounds like the voice of wisdom to me.


> " i never had much time for lucinda williams before."  

Yeah,I didn't used to either.  But I'm now convinced that she belongs with Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash (and so on) as one of the all-time great American songwriters.  If you get a chance, look for "Lonely Girls" and "I Envy the Wind" from her record "Essence."  The structure of the latter makes me insane with jealousy for her talent.  And that's not even mentioning the song "Essence" itself in which she actually sings to a man, "Let me taste your stuff."  That's so N-A-S-T-Y...and, well, um, stimulating.

It's so ridiculously past my bedtime.  Eden and I played The DVD Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit with a couple friend of hers until about 11:00.

I won.

Ha!


* Okay, it's about how most of us have one life to play around with, to do with as we please, but "he" (I was thinking 'W') gets 5 lives to play with every day.  I don't know if that's accurate, but it sure is what it seems like when I listen to the news.  In a way, though, the song is about anybody who wields power over other's lives in a way that is foolish and profligate.  From your reaction and that of a couple other people, I'm not sure I've managed to convey all that.</br></br>

When you say a marketing pitch, do you mean like a rationalization of why my stuff is sellable right now?  Or what?

<b> Jan 21, 2006, at 1:46 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> it might be worth a shot. i'm certainly happy to put in a good word with erik.

here's what you should know:

he gets a lot of demos and he actually pays someone to listen to them. hopefully he'll actually listen himself if i ask him to.
he's negotiating a new distro deal right now that may require him to pare down the roster. depends on which distro he ends up with. one deal is through a major label.
at present, i don't think he's paid for the recording of any record he's put out. i think the bands have.
obviously he likes it when bands tour. though he also kinda has his roster broken into two groups: younger bands that tour like crazy and then break up, and project bands that revolve around a single person and never break up.
if he thought he could sell some, then he'd be more into it. so think about a marketing pitch.</br></br>

The bigger questions for me are: 

What is it I am wanting when I think about sending demos around?

What is the value in "sharing" one's art?

Ryan and I used to argue a lot about the latter question.  He's always had (what seems to be) this genuinely altruistic motive..."I like this, so other people might like it...so why keep it to myself?"  However, he has always been slightly frighteningly messianic about it.

Before when I played in bands I think I wanted to be a rock star.  I used to stand there at work, shoving boards through the planer, and interviewing myself for "Rolling Stone."

That kind of think makes me feel ill now, but the idea of maybe trying to find some way to 1) "share" my music with more people and 2) make some modicum of money by doing so (i.e., at least a living comparable to working at B&N) remains appealing.

The problem is, I know the odds of even minor success just as well as any other thirty-something one-time-schmoozer-wannabe.  Yet I find myself drawn to taking at least small steps.  Clearly this stirs up a lot of conflict for me.  Is that understandable?</br></br>

def mention the players. do it tastefully, but get used to doing it.

think about who yr audience is, who would buy this. how you would write a onesheet to convince journalists to write about it.

yeah, i know this guy martin hall who does p.r. for merge. nice guy. but the fact that he comes to grb shows hasn't ever helped me get their attention as a label. so if you have friend who'll put a cd in the right hands, do it.

for the record, i'm not sure if this will appeal to erik aucoin's (lujo) taste or not. but he does have broad tastes, and he knows quality when he hears it.

i think you should try to get someone to put it out. you don't have to make a crusade out of the whole thing.

<b> Jan 21, 2006, at 9:29 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> so last night i went on my third date with this woman, lisa, whom i met at a church party. she's cute, knows about art and music, used to act and work in the film biz, now nannies. very nice and basically upfront. but...

my question: how do you handle someone who sets off multiple inner alarm bells?

some instances:

last night she was two hours late to pick me up. we missed the art event we were going to. the event wasn't that big a deal; we did something else which was fine. she said she has "time management problems" and has her whole life. (she was late, though not so dramatically, to the other dates too.) i asked if that's something i should budget for in the future. she said yes, or else i should just say that won't do. i basically nicely said it won't do, in a roundabout way. i give her props for being square about that.

she's really putting the full-court press on me. she said she wanted to kiss me both on date #2 and date #3. flattering, yes. but i barely know her. and last night as she was dropping me off, we talked about that, and i explained that i've jumped into things too quickly in the past and i don't know her that well and i'm in a place where i want to feel like i know someone's heart first and that it's just essential that i kiss them if i'm gonna kiss them. etc. and she said something about she already knows, and something to the effect of she doesn't want to wait around given her past history. which brings me to...

her history. which is dramatic with a capital D.
short version: went to catholic school, rebelled with a vengeance, scandalized everyone by dating girls, then boys, then both simultaneously, was involved in some open relationships, risky behaviors, various drugs and things. she's upfront about it, to her credit. "hedonism" is the word she used. okay, so that's kinda whatever, it's in the past. probably repercussions but i don't necessarily have to deal with them.
except that she was involved with one of the main guys in my new church, the church that i totally love. she became a xian by way of him and this church four years ago. been basically celibate since. she was absent from the church for a while because of complications of their romantic situation, which involved other people etc. now shes back. but they're not talking. okay, i'm SO not getting involved in that. but also i really really don't want to piss in my drinking water, you know? she confessed she didn't really want him to know we were hanging out.

apparently she's been using prozac for a long time. again, not a dealbreaker, but most people i know use it for a while and then get weaned off it, but she doesn't want to do that.

apparently she and her dad aren't on speaking terms either.

so here's the thing: she's been totally candid about all this stuff. which i respect tremendously. and if it was all in the past, i don't think it would bother me. but it seems not to be all in the past. even this past week there was fallout from her former involvement with the church guy, a woman he dumped lisa for, that woman's recent and now ex- boyfriend, and that boyfriend who was once involved with lisa by way of one of these open relationship things.

i dunno. the fact that i so desperately want to keep things cool at my church is almost enough right there. i'm not wigged out by her, and i intend to hang out with her more to see how it goes, but i'm in no way ready to push forward. so i'm trying to figure out how to explain my reticence better than i managed last night. i don't think it's a good plan to try to explain the concept of alarm bells.

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: dating question
</b> <br><br> my question: how do you handle someone who sets off multiple inner alarm bells?

My short answer to this is that you come up with a gentle, but definite way to extricate yourself from the situation as soon as possible.

From what you've described, the alarm bells you're hearing are right on.

i dunno. the fact that i so desperately want to keep things cool at my church is almost enough right there.

Again, this sounds like the right impulse.

Some of the behaviors you described (e.g., the impulsive hedonism, bizarre lateness (which is really a lack of awareness/disregard for your time)) are hallmarks of pretty serious psychological distress.  Ditto the intense drama.  The lack of communication with her father makes me wonder what's behind that.  Given what you've described, it's probably something fairly bad.

Here's the thing.  If you attempt to let her down easy, she may freak out on you.  There's nothing you can do about that but remain steady and sure of your position.  It may be possible to be friends with her, but you'll have to always make sure that you're setting very clear boundaries because she likely won't be able to manage those boundaries herself.

Other than antidepressants, is this person receiving help?  I suspect she needs some.

As for what you say to her, I don't think it'd be bad to say that you're looking for someone a bit more settled.  That'd likely set her off, but it's the truth.  The other alternative is to say something that doesn't really say anything, but still gets the message across. That's never been my strong suit, so I can't recommend anything.

Definitely take great care here.  I suspect the whole situation is more volatile than it even seems right now.</br></br>

She's big trouble, Bob.  She probably is crazy, and she probably needs a lot of treatment.

Being angry makes sense in that anger is a mechanism telling us that we don't like some situation.  But I'd avoid showing her that anger.  A cool and speedy withdrawal would be best in my humble (but well informed) opinion.</br></br>

Most mental health professionals think we're at the beginning of an epidemic of personality disorders.

Psychiatric Disorders

 
Borderline Personality Disorder
 
Category

Personality Disorders
 
Etiology

Like most personality disorders, there are many factors that may contribute to the development of symptoms.  Because the symptoms are long lasting, the idea that symptoms begin to emerge in childhood or at least adolescence is well accepted.  The negative consequences of such symptoms, however, may not show themselves until adulthood.
 
Symptoms are often present in adolescence and almost always by young adulthood.  There may be a history of unstable relationships in the person's life and there is a higher than average likelihood of sexual abuse, family violence, and/or neglect in the person's childhood.  This disorder is diagnosed much more frequently in females.
 
Symptoms

The major symptoms of this disorder revolve around unstable relationships, poor or negative sense of self, inconsistent moods, and significant impulsivity.  There is an intense fear of abandonment with this disorder that interferes with many aspects if the individual's life.  This fear often acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy as they cling to others, are very needy, feel helpless, and become overly involved and immediately attached.  When the fear of abandonment becomes overwhelming, they will often push others out of their life as if trying to avoid getting rejected.  The cycle most often continues as the individual will then try everything to get people back in his or her life and once again becomes clingy, needy, and helpless.
 
The fact that people often do leave someone who exhibits this behavior only proves to support their distorted belief that they are insignificant, worthless, and unloved.  At this point in the cycle, the individual may exhibit self-harming behaviors such as suicide attempts, mock suicidal attempts (where the goal is to get rescued and lure others back into the individual's life), cutting or other self-mutilating behavior.  There is often intense and sudden anger involved, directed both at self and others, as well a difficulty controlling destructive behaviors
 
Treatment

Treatment for this disorder is long term in nature since the symptoms have been present for an extended time and interfere with many aspects of the person's life.  Insight oriented therapy can be helpful but research is showing an increased support for a cognitive-behavioral approach.  In other words, the individual's thoughts and actions are monitored both by the self and therapist and specific behaviors are counted and a plan is made to gradually reduce those thoughts and behaviors that are seen as negative.  A combined approach may be best, but either way requires intensive time and effort.
 
Prognosis

Prognosis is difficult to assess.  While the disorder is chronic in nature, gradual improvements with work are definitely seen.  While it is difficult for anyone to change major aspects of their personality, the symptoms of this disorder can be reduced in both number and intensity.  Long term treatment is almost always required.</br></br>

Most mental health professionals think we're at the beginning of an epidemic of personality disorders.

Psychiatric Disorders

 
Borderline Personality Disorder
 
Category

Personality Disorders
 
Etiology

Like most personality disorders, there are many factors that may contribute to the development of symptoms.  Because the symptoms are long lasting, the idea that symptoms begin to emerge in childhood or at least adolescence is well accepted.  The negative consequences of such symptoms, however, may not show themselves until adulthood.
 
Symptoms are often present in adolescence and almost always by young adulthood.  There may be a history of unstable relationships in the person's life and there is a higher than average likelihood of sexual abuse, family violence, and/or neglect in the person's childhood.  This disorder is diagnosed much more frequently in females.
 
Symptoms

The major symptoms of this disorder revolve around unstable relationships, poor or negative sense of self, inconsistent moods, and significant impulsivity.  There is an intense fear of abandonment with this disorder that interferes with many aspects if the individual's life.  This fear often acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy as they cling to others, are very needy, feel helpless, and become overly involved and immediately attached.  When the fear of abandonment becomes overwhelming, they will often push others out of their life as if trying to avoid getting rejected.  The cycle most often continues as the individual will then try everything to get people back in his or her life and once again becomes clingy, needy, and helpless.
 
The fact that people often do leave someone who exhibits this behavior only proves to support their distorted belief that they are insignificant, worthless, and unloved.  At this point in the cycle, the individual may exhibit self-harming behaviors such as suicide attempts, mock suicidal attempts (where the goal is to get rescued and lure others back into the individual's life), cutting or other self-mutilating behavior.  There is often intense and sudden anger involved, directed both at self and others, as well a difficulty controlling destructive behaviors
 
Treatment

Treatment for this disorder is long term in nature since the symptoms have been present for an extended time and interfere with many aspects of the person's life.  Insight oriented therapy can be helpful but research is showing an increased support for a cognitive-behavioral approach.  In other words, the individual's thoughts and actions are monitored both by the self and therapist and specific behaviors are counted and a plan is made to gradually reduce those thoughts and behaviors that are seen as negative.  A combined approach may be best, but either way requires intensive time and effort.
 
Prognosis

Prognosis is difficult to assess.  While the disorder is chronic in nature, gradual improvements with work are definitely seen.  While it is difficult for anyone to change major aspects of their personality, the symptoms of this disorder can be reduced in both number and intensity.  Long term treatment is almost always required.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Okay, great.  Thanks.

Here's who has said what:

Chip Jones (Honor Role) wants to play bass as soon as he and Elissa move back to Richmond.  I'm sure he'd come down to record if it came to that.  He definitely would not be able to tour.

Johnny Hott (Sparklehorse, House of Freaks, Gutterball) has agreed to play drums at least for one show.  I'm pretty sure he'd record, too, but not tour.

John Gotschalk (The Knievels, One Ring Zero) is playing keyboards.  Would record, would not tour. (Nobody knows who the Knievels are, of course, but everybody should.  They were so incredibly great.  Like the Shins 10 years before the Shins.)

Steven McCarthy (The Longryders, The Jayhawks) is somebody I've never met, spoken to, or seen.  Johnny was planning on asking him to play guitar and pedal steel before the horror happened.  I don't know the status of this, so it's probably best not to say anything.

Okay, now cue the harp music, sit back, relax, and enjoy a tall cool glass full of my fantasy life...

Marc Ribot (Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Freedy Johnston, Arto Lindsay, John Lurie, John Zorn, etc., etc.) says he wants to play a solo on "Strange Embrace" that's 10 times cooler than the one on "Hang Down Your Head."

Charlie Hayden (Ornette Coleman,  the good Pat Metheney, Bill Frisell, and so on) has committed to playing bass.

Jim Keltner (Absolutely everybody, but notably (to me) Dylan and E.C.) is drumming on the more straightforward things.  For the less so...

Jim Black (Uri Caine), Bob Moses (played on "Bright Size Life," the first (good) Metheny record), and Joey Barron (Bill Frisell Band) will be lending their craft.

Benmont Tench (The Hearbreakers, everybody else) is playing organ.

Mike Campbell (The Heartbreakers) will be adding some of his incredibly tasteful, quintessentially rock flourishes.  So will...

Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits), though we're not going to let him sing or write lyrics.

Emmylou Harris, Neil Young, and Lucinda Williams are competing for limited slots as harmony vocalists.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Pat Metheny is the supreme cheeseball of all cheeseballs.  It's weird because I truly believe he's one of the most gifted musicians of our era; he is technically capable of absolutely anything and when the moon phase is right (or something) he can be extraordinarily tasteful.  He did one record (now out of print) of weird noise stuff, and the record company stuck labels on them with a quote from Thurston Moore blah-blah-blahing about how important the record was.  I read an interview with Metheny in which he was asked about the Thurston Moore quote, and he basically said, "Thurston who?"  Also, Metheny has recorded with Ornette Coleman a few times and regularly with Coleman's sidemen Billy Higgins and Charlie Haden.

All of that having been said, the vast majority of his output is simply horrible--banal, insipid, boring, saccharine.  I can't think of another musician with such an extremely bifurcated career.</br></br>

I find the prospect of "marketing" the music I've been making recently frankly repugnant, but somehow I can't help myself from sending demos out to labels now and then, and if I'm going to bother to do that, I might as well admit to myself that I'd like one or two of them to respond favorably.  One of the wisemen amongst your ranks said that I ought to have what he called a "marketing plan" in case I ever hear back from anyone to whom I send a disc.  One thing this "marketing plan" ought to include is some kind of statement along the lines of "People who like __________, ___________, and ____________ will also like Timothy Bailey & the Humans."

Here's my request from you: Fill in the blanks.  Name 3 bands/singers/whatever that my music might reasonably be compared to.  Rank them 1 through 3, with 1 being the closest fit and 3 the farthest away.

This is science!

Thanks,

</b> <br><br> Hey Bob,

Here are some more questions about being in a band 10 years on from the last time I did it.

When you sign with an indie label (e.g., Lujo), how much of the stuff that you read about in books about the music industry applies?  For example, do you make sure you have a lawyer look over the deal?  Are you signed for a certain number of albums over a certain period of time, with the label having options to dump you along the way?  Do you actually have a negotiation about royalties and whatnot?  What about tour support?

Or is it all completely low-key and non-business like, as in: Oh, cool, you have these recordings?  Okay, well, we'll pay for them to get pressed, and we'll put our bar code on them, and we'll get them distributed, and you go play a bunch of shows at a loss, and we'll just call it even?

Or is it somewhere in between?

this cellist i met asked me to write her a song, but i scrapped the songs i tried to write for her (first "abstract tennis," then "the nazi in me" -- probably best to leave it alone, she's blonde) and she's got a deadline. so i'm doing a cello version and hoping she won't mind.

would be very interested in hearing about the chesley thing at some point.

still divesting myself of the odd girl situation, but progress is being made. i wish her well but...</br></br>

<b> Jan 31, 2006, at 9:59 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i don't know where this stuff comes from.

"it was the day bjorn stopped hitting the ball 
that the artist was born from a champion
he never realized before the beauty of form
in his movement without a ball's distraction
	'i reject your rankings, my work is no game
	set or match, 15, 30, 40
	ad-in, ad-out must be disavowed
	love will be the only score now'

on the court he could feel
his place in the world
he could also feel the strangeness
of the body grown
into a shape unknown
to the child who first had claimed it

on the court he could feel
the time stand still
with each stroke that divided emptiness
of his life, his heart, his cosmos, his art
to add a ball would bring no more truth to it"

--- and so on</br></br>

I'm having dinner with Chesley tonight.  First Sunday, now Thursday.  

She and I should ONLY be friends.  Two tortured souls rarely make a good couple.  I really hope that the possibility of romance hasn't even occurred to her.  That would make things so much easier.  I am perhaps very attracted to her.

After 7 months or so with Eden, dinner with Chesley the other night was a revelation.  It was like being with someone who speaks your language after being in a foreign city for a long time.  Strong, strong connection.  Maybe some butterflies afterwards.  One half of me really has it bad.  The other half seems to have it's head on its shoulders.  I think maybe I'm not making sense.</br></br>

  EDITORS' NOTE
^top  


The National Prayer Breakfast is normally a time for reaffirming spiritual truths and testifying to the power of faith in people's individual lives, but not so much a moment for prophetic and controversial social utterances. There have been exceptions - when Sen. Mark Hatfield spoke courageously about the moral "shame" of the Vietnam War in the presence of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger (I know a lot about that prayer breakfast speech because I helped write it when I was a seminarian in Chicago); when Mother Theresa spoke about the sacredness of life and raised the issue of abortion with the Clintons on hand; and yesterday, when Bono spoke like a modern-day prophet about extreme global poverty and pandemic disease and called upon the American government, with George Bush and Congressional leaders present, to do much more. 

The speech, published below, was the most explicit about religion and the role of faith that I had ever heard Bono deliver, and his insistence on the biblical requirements of justice and not just charity was reiterated over and over again. In a small session with religious editors afterward, Bono spoke about how the churches had led on the issue of debt cancellation with the Jubilee 2000 campaign, on HIV/AIDS, and now on global poverty reduction. "You're the bigger crowd," he said, "much more than my stadium audiences." He said the church will just hear "fanfare" from musicians. 

But Bono is offering far more than fanfare, as his talk below demonstrates. To the religious editors he stressed how the justice issue is "really it," and said that the churches had to figure out how to make that clear to people and that "movement is the way" we will finally succeed. Bono said he believed that something is moving now and we have to create the momentum to accomplish our goals. On the way to the car afterward, we spoke together about how really crucial that movement building is, how nothing else will suffice to make the changes in our world that are so vitally and morally necessary, and how the strategy in the religious community is so key. We also talked about the Isaiah 58 passage he had quoted in his speech - that when we respond to the poor as the prophet instructs, "God will cover your back." This is one speech you will want to read and pass on to your friends.

Bono's best sermon yet: Remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast

[RUSH TRANSCRIPT: CHECK AGAINST DELIVERED REMARKS]


If you're wondering what I'm doing here, at a prayer breakfast, well, so am I. I'm certainly not here as a man of the cloth, unless that cloth is leather. It's certainly not because I'm a rock star. Which leaves one possible explanation: I'm here because I've got a messianic complex.

Yes, it's true. And for anyone who knows me, it's hardly a revelation.

Well, I'm the first to admit that there's something unnatural...something unseemly...about rock stars mounting the pulpit and preaching at presidents, and then disappearing to their villas in the south of France. Talk about a fish out of water. It was weird enough when Jesse Helms showed up at a U2 concert...but this is really weird, isn't it?

You know, one of the things I love about this country is its separation of church and state. Although I have to say: in inviting me here, both church and state have been separated from something else completely: their mind. 

Mr. President, are you sure about this?

It's very humbling and I will try to keep my homily brief. But be warned - I'm Irish.

I'd like to talk about the laws of man, here in this city where those laws are written. And I'd like to talk about higher laws. It would be great to assume that the one serves the other; that the laws of man serve these higher laws...but of course, they don't always. And I presume that, in a sense, is why you're here.

I presume the reason for this gathering is that all of us here - Muslims, Jews, Christians - all are searching our souls for how to better serve our family, our community, our nation, our God.

I know I am. Searching, I mean. And that, I suppose, is what led me here, too.

Yes, it's odd, having a rock star here - but maybe it's odder for me than for you. You see, I avoided religious people most of my life. Maybe it had something to do with having a father who was Protestant and a mother who was Catholic in a country where the line between the two was, quite literally, a battle line. Where the line between church and state was...well, a little blurry, and hard to see.

I remember how my mother would bring us to chapel on Sundays... and my father used to wait outside. One of the things that I picked up from my father and my mother was the sense that religion often gets in the way of God.

For me, at least, it got in the way. Seeing what religious people, in the name of God, did to my native land...and in this country, seeing God's second-hand car salesmen on the cable TV channels, offering indulgences for cash...in fact, all over the world, seeing the self-righteousness roll down like a mighty stream from certain corners of the religious establishment... 

I must confess, I changed the channel. I wanted my MTV.

Even though I was a believer.

Perhaps because I was a believer.

I was cynical...not about God, but about God's politics. (There you are, Jim.)

Then, in 1997, a couple of eccentric, septuagenarian British Christians went and ruined my shtick - my reproachfulness. They did it by describing the millennium, the year 2000, as a Jubilee year, as an opportunity to cancel the chronic debts of the world's poorest people. They had the audacity to renew the Lord's call - and were joined by Pope John Paul II, who, from an Irish half-Catholic's point of view, may have had a more direct line to the Almighty.

'Jubilee' - why 'Jubilee'?

What was this year of Jubilee, this year of our Lord's favor?

I'd always read the scriptures, even the obscure stuff. There it was in Leviticus (25:35)...

'If your brother becomes poor,' the scriptures say, 'and cannot maintain himself...you shall maintain him.... You shall not lend him your money at interest, not give him your food for profit.' 

It is such an important idea, Jubilee, that Jesus begins his ministry with this. Jesus is a young man, he's met with the rabbis, impressed everyone, people are talking. The elders say, he's a clever guy, this Jesus, but he hasn't done much...yet. He hasn't spoken in public before...


When he does, is first words are from Isaiah: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,' he says, 'because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.' And Jesus proclaims the year of the Lord's favour, the year of Jubilee (Luke 4:18).

What he was really talking about was an era of grace - and we're still in it.

So fast-forward 2,000 years. That same thought, grace, was made incarnate - in a movement of all kinds of people. It wasn't a bless-me club... it wasn't a holy huddle. These religious guys were willing to get out in the streets, get their boots dirty, wave the placards, follow their convictions with actions...making it really hard for people like me to keep their distance. It was amazing. I almost started to like these church people. 

But then my cynicism got another helping hand.

It was what Colin Powell, a five-star general, called the greatest W.M.D. of them all: a tiny little virus called AIDS. And the religious community, in large part, missed it. The ones that didn't miss it could only see it as divine retribution for bad behaviour. Even on children...even [though the] fastest growing group of HIV infections were married, faithful women.

Aha, there they go again! I thought to myself judgmentalism is back!

But in truth, I was wrong again. The church was slow but the church got busy on this the leprosy of our age.

Love was on the move.

Mercy was on the move.

God was on the move.

Moving people of all kinds to work with others they had never met, never would have cared to meet...conservative church groups hanging out with spokesmen for the gay community, all singing off the same hymn sheet on AIDS...soccer moms and quarterbacks...hip-hop stars and country stars. This is what happens when God gets on the move: crazy stuff happens!

Popes were seen wearing sunglasses!

Jesse Helms was seen with a ghetto blaster!

Crazy stuff. Evidence of the spirit.

It was breathtaking. Literally. It stopped the world in its tracks.


When churches started demonstrating on debt, governments listened - and acted. When churches starting organising, petitioning, and even - that most unholy of acts today, God forbid, lobbying...on AIDS and global health, governments listened - and acted. 

I'm here today in all humility to say: you changed minds; you changed policy; you changed the world.

Look, whatever thoughts you have about God, who He is or if He exists, most will agree that if there is a God, He has a special place for the poor. In fact, the poor are where God lives.

Check Judaism. Check Islam. Check pretty much anyone.

I mean, God may well be with us in our mansions on the hill. I hope so. He may well be with us as in all manner of controversial stuff. Maybe, maybe not. But the one thing we can all agree, all faiths and ideologies, is that God is with the vulnerable and poor.

God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house. God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives. God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war. God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives, and God is with us if we are with them. "If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom with become like midday and the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places."

It's not a coincidence that in the scriptures, poverty is mentioned more than 2,100 times. It's not an accident. That's a lot of air time, 2,100 mentions. (You know, the only time Christ is judgmental is on the subject of the poor.) 'As you have done it unto the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me' (Matthew 25:40). As I say, good news to the poor.

Here's some good news for the president. After 9/11 we were told America would have no time for the world's poor. America would be taken up with its own problems of safety. And it's true these are dangerous times, but America has not drawn the blinds and double-locked the doors. 

In fact, you have doubled aid to Africa. You have tripled funding for global health. Mr. President, your emergency plan for AIDS relief and support for the Global Fund - you and Congress - have put 700,000 people onto life-saving anti-retroviral drugs and provided 8 million bed nets to protect children from malaria.

Outstanding human achievements. Counterintuitive. Historic. Be very, very proud. 

But here's the bad news. From charity to justice, the good news is yet to come. There is much more to do. There's a gigantic chasm between the scale of the emergency and the scale of the response.

And finally, it's not about charity after all, is it? It's about justice. 

Let me repeat that: It's not about charity, it's about justice.

And that's too bad. 

Because you're good at charity. Americans, like the Irish, are good at it. We like to give, and we give a lot, even those who can't afford it. 

But justice is a higher standard. Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice; it makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties, it doubts our concern, it questions our commitment. 

Sixty-five hundred Africans are still dying every day of a preventable, treatable disease, for lack of drugs we can buy at any drug store. This is not about charity, this is about justice and equality. 
Because there's no way we can look at what's happening in Africa and, if we're honest, conclude that deep down, we really accept that Africans are equal to us. Anywhere else in the world, we wouldn't accept it. Look at what happened in South East Asia with the tsunami. 150,000 lives lost to that misnomer of all misnomers, "mother nature." In Africa, 150,000 lives are lost every month. A tsunami every month. And it's a completely avoidable catastrophe. 

It's annoying but justice and equality are mates. Aren't they? Justice always wants to hang out with equality. And equality is a real pain.
You know, think of those Jewish sheep-herders going to meet the Pharaoh, mud on their shoes, and the Pharaoh says, "Equal?" A preposterous idea: rich and poor are equal? And they say, "Yeah, 'equal,' that's what it says here in this book. We're all made in the image of God." 

And eventually the Pharaoh says, "OK, I can accept that. I can accept the Jews - but not the blacks."

"Not the women. Not the gays. Not the Irish. No way, man." 

So on we go with our journey of equality.

On we go in the pursuit of justice.

We hear that call in the ONE Campaign, a growing movement of more than 2 million Americans...Left and Right together... united in the belief that where you live should no longer determine whether you live.


We hear that call even more powerfully today, as we mourn the loss of Coretta Scott King - mother of a movement for equality, one that changed the world but is only just getting started. These issues are as alive as they ever were; they just change shape and cross the seas.

Preventing the poorest of the poor from selling their products while we sing the virtues of the free market...that's a justice issue. Holding children to ransom for the debts of their grandparents...that's a justice issue. Withholding life-saving medicines out of deference to the Office of Patents...that's a justice issue. 

And while the law is what we say it is, God is not silent on the subject.

That's why I say there's the law of the land¿. And then there is a higher standard. There's the law of the land, and we can hire experts to write them so they benefit us, so the laws say it's OK to protect our agriculture but it's not OK for African farmers to do the same, to earn a living?

As the laws of man are written, that's what they say.

God will not accept that.

Mine won't, at least. Will yours?

[ pause]

I close this morning on...very...thin...ice.

This is a dangerous idea I've put on the table: my God vs. your God, their God vs. our God...vs. no God. It is very easy, in these times, to see religion as a force for division rather than unity.

And this is a town - Washington - that knows something of division.

But the reason I am here, and the reason I keep coming back to Washington, is because this is a town that is proving it can come together on behalf of what the scriptures call the least of these.

This is not a Republican idea. It is not a Democratic idea. It is not even, with all due respect, an American idea. Nor it is unique to any one faith. 

'Do to others as you would have them do to you' (Luke 6:30). Jesus says that.

'Righteousness is this: that one should...give away wealth out of love for him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for the emancipation of the captives.' The Koran says that (2.177).


Thus sayeth the Lord: 'Bring the homeless poor into the house, when you see the naked, cover him, then your light will break out like the dawn and your recovery will speedily spring fourth, then your Lord will be your rear guard.' The Jewish scripture says that. Isaiah 58 again. 

That is a powerful incentive: 'The Lord will watch your back.' Sounds like a good deal to me, right now.

A number of years ago, I met a wise man who changed my life. In countless ways, large and small, I was always seeking the Lord's blessing. I was saying, you know, I have a new song, look after it¿. I have a family, please look after them¿. I have this crazy idea...

And this wise man said: stop.

He said, stop asking God to bless what you're doing.

Get involved in what God is doing - because it's already blessed.

Well, God, as I said, is with the poor. That, I believe, is what God is doing. 

And that is what he's calling us to do.

I was amazed when I first got to this country and I learned how much some churchgoers tithe. Up to 10% of the family budget. Well, how does that compare with the federal budget, the budget for the entire American family? How much of that goes to the poorest people in the world? Less than 1%. 

Mr. President, Congress, people of faith, people of America:


I want to suggest to you today that you see the flow of effective foreign assistance as tithing.... Which, to be truly meaningful, will mean an additional 1% of the federal budget tithed to the poor.

What is 1%?

1% is not merely a number on a balance sheet. 

1% is the girl in Africa who gets to go to school, thanks to you. 1% is the AIDS patient who gets her medicine, thanks to you. 1% is the African entrepreneur who can start a small family business thanks to you. 1% is not redecorating presidential palaces or money flowing down a rat hole. This 1% is digging waterholes to provide clean water.



1% is a new partnership with Africa, not paternalism toward Africa, where increased assistance flows toward improved governance and initiatives with proven track records and away from boondoggles and white elephants of every description.

America gives less than 1% now. We're asking for an extra 1% to change the world. to transform millions of lives - but not just that and I say this to the military men now - to transform the way that they see us. 

1% is national security, enlightened economic self-interest, and a better, safer world rolled into one. Sounds to me that in this town of deals and compromises, 1% is the best bargain around.

These goals - clean water for all; school for every child; medicine for the afflicted, an end to extreme and senseless poverty - these are not just any goals; they are the Millennium Development goals, which this country supports. And they are more than that. They are the Beatitudes for a globalised world.

Now, I'm very lucky. I don't have to sit on any budget committees. And I certainly don't have to sit where you do, Mr. President. I don't have to make the tough choices. 

But I can tell you this:

To give 1% more is right. It's smart. And it's blessed.

There is a continent - Africa - being consumed by flames.

I truly believe that when the history books are written, our age will be remembered for three things: the war on terror, the digital revolution, and what we did - or did not to - to put the fire out in Africa.

History, like God, is watching what we do. 

Thank you. Thank you, America, and God bless you all.

<b> Feb 20, 2006, at 12:18 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Hi Bob,

How are you?  What's going ahn?

My News:

1) I think Chesley and I will be married within a year.  Maybe 6 months.  Maybe 2 months.  It's like there's just no reason not to be married.  It is what people talk about when they talk about love.  It's similar to the other time I was in big love (Laura), but without the horrible misgivings and bad dreams.  It's not only in the movies, I guess.

2) Got word today that this guy Stephen McCarthy is going to play guitar and pedal steel in my band.  He was in the Long Ryders and then the Jayhawks, and I really like his playing a lot.  It's kind of exciting.  I'm trying to book a show at Ashland Coffee & Tea, but they're booked at least through May.  You know what would be sooooo great?  If my first show could be opening for GRB.  If there's even the faintest possibility of that, let me know and I'll get you the contact info for the woman who books the shows.  There's no way I'd be able to play there on my own steam, and dropping Johnny and Stephen's names seemed to help only the tiniest amount.   Anyhow, if it works out I think it's going to be like a waking dream for me.  Wow that would be awesome if I could play with your band.</br></br>

<b> Feb 20, 2006, at 12:45 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Interesting about THE SPARROW.  Now I'll read it.  It'd been recommended to me before, but not by someone with your taste.

I don't know about Vijay Iyer.  What should I listen to?

Drummers.  Geez.  I guess Ricky's style isn't quite right, huh?  I think you should try to get in touch with Jim Black, the guy who plays with Uri Caine.  There's no reason he'd say yes, but what the hell.  He'd be so great with your stuff.

May I hear the song please?

Money, not panicking.  Best wishes.  I feel your pain, dude.  Truly.

Do you want to send a CD and press kit to Ashland Coffee & Tea?  They've had some pretty amazing people come through there.</br></br>

But note: "Most new musicians we schedule come to us through their representing agency and/or our current musicians. We are unfortunately just not able to listen to all the CDs we receive by direct mail or cold call."

Even so, I think you should propose headlining a show in June w/Timothy Bailey & the Humans opening.

<b> Feb 20, 2006, at 3:37 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> dude.

a) WOW. full stop.

b) oddly, ken from gutbucket just asked me if i wanted to do a short may GRB tour up the east coast. also, i'll be around dc in june to record GRB #3. so there are options there too.

man. it does feel good to hear that much good news from yr quarters all at once.

me: going to missouri this weekend for david wilson's true/false film festival. stoked.
trying to finish screenplay.
just finished cello/voice version of that 'windows on the world' song. reasonably happy w/ it.
trying to juggle plans for sxsw and find a drummer to sit in. already had two say yes, and then have to back out.
am determined to be faithful in my thinking about finances (i.e. not panic).
reading this book: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449912558/sr=8-1/qid=1140467759/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-3681129-5135820?%5Fencoding=UTF8
which kicks just a silly amount of ass, despite my suspicion that i wouldn't be into it. i think you'd like it.
am pining for a girl and a dog. but also content to wait for the right ones.
now must write about jazz guy vijay iyer, who's very good.

bob</br></br>

<b> Feb 20, 2006, at 4:15 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> re drummers: trick is to find someone who's already gonna be there. me, jean and durst are flying in. all the tour venues on the way were booked four months in advance and i missed it.

i've downloaded vijay iyer stuff online somewhere, i forget. he does piano stuff, but he also collaborates with this hip hop guy names mike ladd. probably anything you find is worth a listen. yr mileage may vary.

do you know who to talk to at ashland coffee and tea?

crappy midi version of the song attached. not sure that i like it better than the other one, but i'm glad it's done.

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  A Joke That Only You Will Get
</b> <br><br> Here's a joke that only you will get.

_________________________________________________________________

Nick Cave and Tom Waits walk into a bar.

In Singapore.

The bartender squints.
He's a Filipino dwarf who looks like Morrissey,
but with a scar beneath one eye.
He's dressed up like Napoleon,
and it's hard not to hear his cry...

"Josephine, Oh Josephine,
Come to me, but do not bathe.
Come to me, but do not bathe."

A scythe hangs on the wall
above the shrunken heads
and golden idols,
above the candles and the booze.

Nick and Tom sit down at the bar,
nodding at the bandleader
in his dinner jacket
singing
"You Don't Know What Love Is"
to all the dancers
and the cigarette girls
in their sequins.

"What'll it be, Nick?
What'll be Tom,"
asks Napoleon,
looking not at them but
at the glass he's holding up to the dim light,
polishing off the lipstick
and the spots.

The pair consider
their options--
first the stuff in bottles,
then the stuff in jars.

Nick lights a cigarette,
takes a drag,
and says to Tom, "The first rule of holes
is when you're in one--
stop digging."

Tom wheezes out a laugh
and orders two club sodas.

The smoke is so thick
you'd think you were at a
pig roast in someone's closet.

Men in suits and
merchant marines
file out the back door
to bet on cockfights.
An ancient chinese
with a long Fu Manchu
sits in the corner
without expression,
a thin pipe dangling from his mouth.

A marimba made of old tailpipes
supports a muted trumpet solo
so sad it makes all the tattooed tears
in the room
burn
in sympathy.

Tom says, "So
Nick, how the hell you been?"

______________________________________________________________

That's all I got so far.

I want the set to collapse and everyone involved to fall into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: checking
</b> <br><br> That's good to hear.

Okay, the play by play.

~'93: I meet Chesley at World Cup, where her twin sister Alexa is the manager.

~'96-'97 or '98: Chesey and I spend a lot of time hanging out at Schaefer court while we're both finishing up our undergrad degrees kinda late in life.  We've both suffered from similar situations both inside and outside ourselves.  A very strong sense of affinity and camaraderie develops.  Then she disappears, and I'm somewhat baffled.  She is married during this period.  Very unhappily so.  To Brian Murkeson (sp?).  Do you know him?

~6 weeks ago:  Out to dinner with some friends, I see Chesley waiting in line for a movie at the Westhampton.  So happy to see each other.  Had heard through the grapevine about her divorce and her moving to SF to be a buddhist nun (didn't pan out).  She'd heard about my difficulties.  Get her number.  Call her.

~Last week of Jan: Dinner at Mekong.  Feeling of intense fellowship; kinda indescribable.  Similar cultural references, similar backgrounds both good and bad.  Similar interests, values.  I have butterflies in my stomach.  We part ways, not even a hug.

Feb 2: Dinner at Mama Zu.  Transcript follows:

Both of us:  Blah Blah Blah about this that and the other.

Me (suddenly):  Chesley, here's the thing.  I'm going to fall in love with you.

Chesley:  Yes, me too.  I'm going to fall in love with you, too.

Time since then:  True comfort like I've never known.  Lots of candor.  Lots of hilarity.  Lots of frank discussion.  Feeling of rightness unknown to either of us.  Strong mutual realization that this is "it."

Turns out the reason she disappeared in '98 or so is that she was developing powerful feelings for me, and although her marriage was a disaster, she did not want to forge an inappropriate emotional bond beyond its boundaries.  A very good thing, because I don't think we were ready for each other back then.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> It's looking like the Ashland Coffee and Tea gig might not happen.  They're kinda being big for their britches.  Not a definite no-go just yet, but not likely.

So I'm thinking of trying to set something up with TB&TH and GRB at a gallery called Expansion Joint.  Some very good bands have played there in the past.  I know it's a ways off, but are you able to give me a date during that June 11-22 time slot when we might play a show?  Saturdays, Sundays, and Thursdays are out.  Friday would be best, of course.

Perhaps we should try and talk soon.</br></br>

Anyway, I'm listening to the Loincloth demo right now.  Good grief!  How do they do this stuff?

And good for John Morand--I'd say he got it right this time!</br></br>

i dunno dude. i guess at this point they just think that way. and they practice. so how was it meeting pen? i've met him like to say hello but i doubt he'd remember me.

</b> <br><br> Man, I hope SXSW is good for you again this year.  I wish I could go down there for that.

Meeting Pen was fine.  I've gotten pretty friendly with his boyfriend (although I'm not 100% sure I've read the relationship right) Chris, with whom I work.  So Chris has told me a lot about Pen and vice versa.  Pen is an easy guy to talk to, intense about his art, pretty relaxed about everything else it seemed.  It was a good time; I think I'll definitely hang out at the Snooze Bar when it happens hence forth.  Only downside is the chain-smoking!

Pen told me all about the Loincloth recording session.  The drummer was there for 4 hours including set-up time.  So he pretty much got everything in one take.  None of the drumming is improvised--every last little click is planned.  If you pan hard left you get Pen's guitar--hard right for Tannon.  I'm listening to the left channel right now.  Geez.

We also had a good talk about whether or not he's actually going to send my demo to Mac at Merge.  I don't know if he will or not, but I'm not sure it really matters.

Happy trails!</br></br>

To those of you who participated:  THANKS, and make sure you check for ticks if you haven't already!

Next up: Cherub Records will be releasing "Ecoutez! Ecoutez!" a 5 song EP culled from the stuff I've been recording at home over the last six months or so.

I hope this finds you all well.

Best,

Tim

As for becoming a rock star, that'd be okay, I guess.  I'd like the money.  Not sure about the rest of it, though.  Happily, it's a non-issue.

P.J. deserves all the credit for the photos.  That dude has an eye.  I've been encouraging him to talk to you about taking some GRB photos next month when y'all are recording, but he's reluctant because of some kind of bad blood with Chad.  (Chad?)  Something to do with a CD mastering project, I dunno.

I started a new job yesterday.  It kinda sucks, but the money is okay.  Ah, work. 

What's up with you?

<b> May 16, 2006, at 10:02 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> hello stereo!

this thing is super effing cool. i like the acapella ("without capella") parts. a lot. and how the guitars come in.

is that a garage band drum sequence? man. so funny how convincing those things are.

i will be in dc come june 3. recording starts june 12, ends the 22. then i'm around for at least another week and maybe more. when will we hang?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Hello Bob.

Yes, let us definitely perpetrate the hangification when you have on this coast arrived.  I want to play on the new GRB album.  I have an alto AND a tenor recorder.  Well, I have an alto here, anyway.  It's on the floor.

Glad you liked the song.  Both of Chesley's father's grandmothers were committed to Central State Hospital, which is to this day about as bleak and horrid a place as can be imagined.  They were left there to rot.  Kinda like the grandmother I found out about last year.  As for the drums--those are real, not MIDI.  Apparently, Apple spent a lot of time and energy recording real players in good studios.  The samples typically run for 4 to 8 beats.  They can be looped, and the tempo can be altered within reason.  When you crank a beat recorded at 90 bpm up to 150, it gets weird, but shy of that, it works great.  Of course, you can't change the stereo field of individual drums, but like, whatever.

I LOVE GARAGEBAND!

I have a new job, and have never liked work more.  It's more than likely a kind of honeymoon, but I'm enjoying the heck out of it so far.  It's a woodworking thing.

Out-take photo attached!

Tim</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: Re: Re: Re:
</b> <br><br> Yes, it sounds like next week will be better.  Are you recording on a budget from Lujo?  That must be nice if so.  I can't wait to hear all of this.

Things are good, but a little stressful here.  The guitar-player slot in TB&TH has been moving around a lot.  First it was supposed to be this guy Stephen McCarthy from The Long Ryders & Jayhawks, but he has taken Bryan Harvey's place in NRGKRYS, an amazing soul covers band.  So he dropped out.   At a loss, I asked P.J. to do it.  He and I got together a couple of times, and while he's just such a super person, his playing wasn't what I was looking for.  John Gotschalk then asked Armistead Wellford, who was in Love Tractor in the 80's and has since played with Sparklehorse, etc., etc.  He immediately said yes.  So I had to "fire" P.J., and though he took it very well, it wasn't comfortable at all.  In the end, though, I've gotten what I wanted, namely a band full of absolute ringers.  I'm pretty excited about the show.

In other band news, this guy Dan Portnoy who has a podcast called The Drop (http://thedroponline.com/) is planning a special live podcast of the show in July.  Apparently he has as many as 7000 subscribers, so that's kinda cool.  Also, P.J.'s label has released an EP of my stuff, and he's working it pretty hard.  Have I mentioned what a great guy P.J. is?  Anyhow, the CD has really cool hand-made packaging.  Chesley did linoleum and woodcut prints for it.

Speaking of Chesley, we're getting married July 1.  It's pretty great.

And really, that's all I know.

Someone tell Sam Jackson he's my bro!

Best,

Tim</br></br>

<b> Jun 17, 2006, at 9:49 AM / Bob / </b> <br><br> best part so far was rehearsals. everyone was an ace. and nice people.

recording's fun but jean, the violin player, has been stressing me out lately, so that was taxing.

also, it's been so long since i had to play with accurate timing that i found my guitar stuff to be pretty sloppy.

vocals start monday. hoping hoping hoping it goes easily.

i'll enjoy next week more, i think, because chad takes over from t.j. the engineer. i like t.j. but chad's a good friend and always full of amazing conversation.

how goes the TM&tH? and cetera.</br></br>

<b> Jun 17, 2006, at 10:46 AM / Bob / </b> <br><br> dooder -

no lujo budget. i wish. erik's deal is that if your last record recoups, he'll give you a budget for the next one. so maybe i'll have a budget for the next album. hopefully this one will sell enough to get my dough back.

the guitarist thing sounds rough, but it's just a truth that people come with widely varying kinds of chops. i asked jason to try to play this bridge thing that was sorta 60s soul because i thought it might be in his bag of chops, but it wasn't. not in mine either, though i had to fake it after jason couldn't do it. i'm sure p.j. has specific chops in his bag, as i do and you do. chop bags, that's what i call them. meaty chop bags. actually i don't call them anything since i just made that up. but it sounds nice and gross.

dude, how do i get one of those eps? i almost managed to hook up with p.j. last week but everything was nuts.

you are getting married in two weeks.

holy shiznit!

The new GRB song seems so different.  So...pop.  But maybe I only think that because you said you were making a pop record.  I love the song's sentiment.

there's no date yet for the record release but it won't be until after the new year. lujo is changing distributors and there's this whole complicated thing. it's probably fine. gives me a chance to get my shiz together -- book some tours and do a video maybe and ready the p.r.  i'm gonna bust some ass on this one.
i might also send it around to a couple other labels, not because i'm unhappy with lujo, but just to see if anyone has any interesting reactions.
DAG i wish i could be there for that show. shit.

i actually think of that song often. being randy newman, i'm sure it's ironic, but i suspect not entirely.

which is why he's so well regarded.

i just hope i don't start writing shit like "ventura highway" or whatever that bob seger song is about hollywood nights in those hollywood hills, she's looking so right in her diamonds and frills. or whatever he vomited up.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Wow, that sounds great.  

Sometimes one has to just stand back and say to oneself, "Things really do improve sometimes."</br></br>

<b> Jul 9, 2006, at 6:02 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> a) the weather. cliche but true.

b) if yr a creative type, no one thinks you're crazy. people respect the shit out of that here. probably because there is actual money to be had by creating things. but still. everyone gets the struggle and the process and all that. seriously, the guy who fixes your flat tire will be like "are you in a band? can i have a cd?" people think it's great.

c) it's just freaking beautiful terrain. i can see the mountains and the beach from my neighborhood. l.a. itself: not so beautiful. unless you think donut shops and liquor stores are beautiful. but i already find myself filtering that stuff out.

d) the community of xians here is something i never dreamed i would encounter. people like me! it's messed up. hundreds and hundreds. people who get it, you don't have to explain your life to them, they already know the story because they've been through it. and they're not wackos. man is that awesome. i can't explain how starved i was for that, and i didn't really realize the extent until i got here.

e) other details:  there's actually an amazing art scene here. there's also a music underbelly to kind of balance out the ryan seacrest factor. lots of noise bands. which i don't need in my daily diet, but it makes for a nice palate-cleanser. there's an amazing park right in the middle of the city, kinda like central park in nyc, but it's the hills where the hollywood sign and griffith observatory are. mostly, though, the best thing is the people i've met.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Hello Everybody,

Please pardon the group email, but it's a hectic week!

Below, you'll find answers to some frequently asked questions about this Friday's Timothy Bailey & The Humans show.  

Please forward this email to anyone you suppose would be interested!

Best,

A. It's at Ashland Coffee & Tea in Ashland, VA.

Q.  Okay, but how do I get there?

A. Here's how to get to Ashland Coffee & Tea from Interstate 95

    > Get on I-95 North in Richmond. (Or South if you’re coming from the D.C. area)

    > Take Exit 92 (Route 54 West) towards Ashland.

Thanks!


who's playing what?

Me: acoustic guitar

John Gotschalk: electric guitar & backing vocals

Johnny Hott: drums

Corey Waldrop: bass

Chocolate: keyboards

Yes, Chocolate.  He's a genius.  He's been playing piano for 2 years.  He can listen to an entire Herbie Hancock solo once then play it back by ear.  He turned 18 on the day of the show.  He has perfect pitch.  And so on.



what's next? 

Who can say?  Johnny is touring behind the new Sparklehorse album.  Europe for two months then several weeks in Japan.  Maybe we'll play again in six months.  I'd like to do a record, but I refuse to pay for it.


SHIT I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE

Me too!  That would have been great.



i played a show here in l.a. the other night. well attended. but if i could have fired a violinist onstage i would have. she completely fell apart. but she's a friend. oh well. 

That's great that it was well attended.  What happened to the violinist?  Was it Jean?</br></br>

Timothy Bailey and the Humans — Ecoutez! Ecoutez!

Richmond-based Timothy Bailey and the Humans write Americana roots  rock with eclectic pop twists. Their songs are sweeping with many  different pieces woven in for extra delight. Vocally it’s driven by  multiple harmonies and sweet melodies. Nice organ play adds an  extra dimension. Good stuff.

simply because it kind of falls into an idiom that i don't know how to do the "right" way, if you know what i mean.

You'll be able to open the file in either Garageband or Logic.  If you've not used Garageband, you should try it.  It's so easy and great.

</b> <br><br> Chesley "suffers" from extreme (she says "mild") synesthesia all the time, so I asked her.  Here's what she saw:

Long, slow shots of city streets, hyper-saturated color, real people walking up and down the sidewalks.  All different kinds of people.  Shot runs in a car/on a dolly parallel to the sidewalks being shot.  Periodic shots of people with "Body piercing saved my life" tee-shirts.  Different colored tee shirts on different people, but make sure the text is visible.  Random cuts, not in time with the song.

So there you have it.

Next, I will send you a song I'm working on.</br></br>

<b>  September 2, 2006 at 12:39:20 PM PDT
 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Saint Theresa
</b> <br><br> Last Sunday Chesley was out walking the dog when she saw an old lady with a rosary riding her bike in circles in the parking lot of the baptist church we live near.  She came in and said, "I'm not saying you should use this in a song, but you definitely can if you want..."

So, here's what I got so far.  There will eventually be lyrics in the choruses.  The drummer is Michael Blair, who played on "Rain Dogs" and at various points with Elvis Costello.  He has made some Apple Loops available for free.</br></br>

<b> Sep 2, 2006, at 2:40 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> hoss -

a) tuesday: played well, but not many people came and it turned into one of those existential moments where i was like "why have i wasted my life on this again?" though fwiw the other more established acts didn't bring anyone in either.

b) someone told me about taxi.com. i have no other significant info. it seems like as good an option as any as long as it costs you nothing up front. i'm compiling a list of music supervisors, but i think sending them music is much like sending demos to labels. le sigh.

c) so i'm supposed to get a video made for this new GRB song called "fuccups of the world unite." you've heard this, right? which is essentially about me being sick of seeing the bible used as a weapon. i have a director and stuff but we're not coming up with ideas that make me happy. so i'm canvassing my friends. the song names a whole litany of types of people who might be considered fuckups by churchy types (goths, porn stars, marching band, writers, drunks (same thing as writers really), pop stars, homeless, gay folks, etc.).

if you were me, what concept would you use for that song? --bearing in mind it has to be cheap. ideally something a little funny, a little profound, a little mysterious, a little sexy. or a lot sexy.

feel free to ask around. all suggestions welcome.

i'll attach a very rough mix of the song.

muchas gracias,
bob

Things are good here.  I could be leaving my job to start my own shop.  I could also not be.  I may be getting a large portion of the woodworking for a new, expensive gallery at a museum.  Hopefully I'll know more soon.  If it happens, it will be a wild ride until the end of February.  If it doesn't, I like my current job just fine, so no big loss.

<b> Sep 29, 2006, at 4:33 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> i'm willing to bet that when i was 20 i wrote some smarmy reviews just like that one. i'm glad i realized it was cheap to be a critic.

sometimes bands find a way to wryly quote the bad reviews in their ads and stuff, and this slays me with laughter.

things = yesterday was a shitty day. shitstorm on all fronts. today things look better. probably a matter of perspective. like, i walk around looking at my shoes all day, stuck on the shadows, and then look up to remember the sun. cheesy, but then, i'm a fuckwad.

how's things there?</br></br>

<b> Oct 1, 2006, at 6:18 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> oh, just everything at once.
started with a frustrating two-hour call to apple trying to get a replacement battery for my ipod. long, tedious story, but i was trying to use a $50 store credit for the repair, various people assured me it was cool, and then finally some guy said it was not, but it was byzantine and immensely frustrating.

I had pretty much this exact same experience trying to use my $50 credit.  It was very frustrating.

and chad's allegedly mixing my record, but it was supposed to be done a couple weeks ago, but he had some computer problem and some emotional problem, so it didn't happen, but he said i'd have mixed by today, but he won't return my calls and emails asking what the status is.

Yikes.  That's not so good.


and then erik at lujo emailed me to try to push back the release date to july and also politely added that the grb wasn't a priority because other bands sell better, etc etc, but i'm busting my ass here to get a booking agent and to shoot not one but two videos, and to have the master and art done by the end of october for the march release date he promised. i got him on the phone and got that dealt with (release: first tues in april) but i wanted to break shit. it's one thing to change the date, it's another not to tell me for months and then spring it on me when plans are underway.

Whoa.  I'm glad you found a compromise date, but it sucks that it had to be a negotiation when a date had already been settled.

and i had to try to get some details out of my friend scott about the odds of our screenplay project actually getting bought or championed by this bigshot director we're writing this for. i've spent crazy time and sweat on this and we're about to spend more, but there's no guarantee, and i'm about at the end of my available credit.

Why  can't people like us just be interested in, say, finance instead of art?  It's much easier to make a living at that stuff.

and there's some ambient girl stuff. went on a couple dates, fine but not that promising.
and i'm just so broke and juggling bills and people owe me money and i don't have my rent AGAIN, etc etc.

Ouch.


whatever.

dude, start your own shop? that would be amazing. what's the gallery project?

It's for a big museum.  I submitted an unsolicited proposal.  Hopefully I'll know more next week, but their gears seem to move slowly.  It would be five months of intense work, but there's a chance that at the end of that I'd have a year's rent paid at a space and my machinery free and clear.


someday when i have some spare dough i think i would love to commission you to build me something that holds my huge keyboard. i've been thinking about finding the shell of an old organ or something. i just hate keyboard stands, they're so cheesy. but that's down the road...

Dude, I'd do that for you for free.  Usually I don't say that, but I am saying it now.


as for the humans, you know, what you do isn't for 20 year olds, really. so you shouldn't be surprised if they don't get it. you should be very surprised when some of them do get it. they're the people who write for websites, mostly, and places like delusions of adequacy have no discernable editorial standards, you know?

</b> <br><br> Wow, that is really too bad about Chad.  Geez.  If his partner can't do it, I wonder if you'd consider Sound of Music?  There are lots of people there now I've been hearing good things about--not just John Morand anymore.  But really, man, that sucks.  And I don't have anybody I'd mention it to, so don't sweat it: My lips are sealed.

Someday remind me to tell you the story of my most rock 'n roll moment.  It involves Ricky, "Surrender," an unplugged electric bass, and about 1500 people.

If I do wind up with my own shop, and if I have slow times, I'm dead serious about doing the keyboard thing.  Whether you like it or not.

Thanks for the list!</br></br>

<b> Oct 1, 2006, at 8:26 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> just got a long email from chad. very long story. i had sort of intuited a lot of it. he basically had a technical meltdown at the studio compounded by a heavy emotional breakdown precipitated by overwork. (please keep that confidential.) so he regretfully resigned from doing my record. not quite sure what's gonna happen now.

this is stressful but i think it will work out. maybe his partner, t.j., will mix it. not what i want but an option.

it's funny how this band is as much about cosmic patience as about music. probably good for me or something.

i'm listening to cheap trick and it is pretty satisfying in a certain sugary way. mommy's alright, daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird.

while i would love and be honored to get you to build me a keyboard thingy, i don't know that i could accept that for free. that is real and actual work. but maybe we could work something out. barter? not sure what i can offer that you want. installment plan?

you know, this song "dream police" is pretty hot.

i am attaching a word doc that is my totally un-cleaned-up list of music supervisors. i'm still compiling the list, but it's people who put music in movies and tv. sending to them cold is long odds but better odds than sending demos to labels. and they actually prefer to place unsigned or indie bands/musicians who control their own publishing. less stuff to clear.
perhaps this will be useful. i intend to make extensive use of it when and if i have finished mixes.

Incredibly rough day.

Coworker had one horrible hell of an accident.

Kinda spaced out, in shock the rest of the day.  Left work.

Started sobbing after dinner.

Basically, a giant knife came off a machine and more-or-less cut this guy's hand in half between his ring and middle fingers.

Lots of thick blood.

As for Richard himself, all I know is that he was in surgery from 1:15 until at least 5:00.  Probably longer.  The accident happened at about 8:15.  I hope he doesn't lose his trade.  He's not equipped to do anything else.

Here's the basic idea:

Black screen.  White title comes up: "Classic Rock, Literally."

6.Black Dog/Led Zeppelin
	1.Slow-motion, dramatic shot of Haiku
7.I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/U2
	1.Looking around for keys
8.Touch Me/The Doors
9.Takin' Care of Business
	1.Straining on the toilet
10.While My Guitar Gently Weeps
	1.Extremely cheesy weeping guitar effect
11.Tangled Up in Blue/Dylan
12.Refugee/Tom Petty
	1.Poor-taste refugee getup
13.Every Little Thing She Does/The Police
	1.Cheesy appearance/disappearance stuff w/the camera
14.Sharp Dressed Man/ZZ Top
	1.Razor blade suit, needles, etc.
15.Day Tripper/The Beatles
	1.Tripping on something, hah!
16.I Only Have Eyes For You/Flamingos
	1.Someone off screen presents person on screen w/bowl full of eyeballs
17.Foxy Lady/Jimi Hendrix
	1.Woman dressed up in fox getup doing dishes or something
18.Cold as Ice/Foreigner
	1.Shot of Chesley tinted blue
19.Sunday Bloody Sunday/U2
	1.Shot of an ice cream Sundae; blood dumped onto it from out of frame
20.Burning For You/B.O.C.
	1.This should follow “I'm on Fire” and use the same video, ditto for other fire songs.</br></br>

for real about tony hale, btw. it's not a done deal yet. but he goes to my church and the video director is really tight with him. he's got an improv comedy troupe -- maybe called KingBaby? something like that.

<b> Oct 23, 2006, at 5:39 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> this is from my ical "christian holidays" calendar:

According to Bishop James Ussher (1581-1656), God created the universe on October 23, 4004 BC. That would make the universe 6000 years old in 1997 AD. James Ussher was an Irish Archbishop whose chronology of Biblical history was widely accepted throughout Christianity.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I drive to the mill on East Laburnum.

John Stein was shot on East Laburnum.
He drove to the mill with a rag stuffed in the wound.

And that's a true story about a guy who used to work where I work now.  He was shot at a convenience store one morning on the way in, stuffed a rag in the wound, then worked the whole day.  He never did get medical attention and died two years later when the bullet moved.</br></br>

You'd better put another washer on that spindle, boy.
Put another washer on that spindle.
Put another washer on that spindle, boy

The blades of death are spinning 'round again.
The blades of death, they know your name.
If the blades of death should slip the collars, boy,
flesh and bone is all the same to them.
Flesh and bone is all the same.

When I was a boy I had a teacher.
He did his best to teach us well.
He said, "If you want to keep
all ten fingers, boy,
never, ever cut towards yourself.
Never cut towards yourself."

The blades of death are spinning 'round again.
The blades of death, they know your name.
If the blades of death should slip those collars, boy,
flesh and bone is all the same to them.
Flesh and bone is all the same.

<b> Nov 30, 2006, at 8:28 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> i have thought about it, in passing. i would do it if i had a label over there, maybe.

it might be really awesome to move to amsterdam for six months. that guy minco eggersman lives there and he's good people. it's so interesting how americana goes over so crazy in europe.

i have indeed gotten orphans. haven't had a chance to listen all the way through yet. fucker couldn't be bothered to put a pdf of the booklet online, though. i heard there's good stuff in the cd booklet.

i also got "u2 by u2" which is those guys talking in their own words about their career, from start to now. it's pretty mind blowing.

today i am fucking super stressed because my album art just sucks and i don't know what to do about it. i shouldn't try to do everything by myself, but i can't afford a designer. also i'm realizing how much ass i have to bust to get ready for march tour. the guys i've been playing with here probably won't be able to go. i have to find a fucking band in a town where i don't know enough musicians. i'm gonna have a drink with ricky and see what he can suggest. i'm gonna play every other card i have too. but shit.

also, most dudes here want real money, which i dont' have.</br></br>

<b> Nov 30, 2006, at 10:28 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> got the book on amazon. it's a coffee table book, kinda pricey, but i had a gift certificate sitting around.

stress. yes. i overcommit.

album art concept was hot mysterious girl in front of backdrop with all this lettering painted on it which includes the album title, "flesh and spirits." the photog didn't really give me what i needed. which is probably my fault. but now i'm scrambling. i'll send some examples. thoughts / suggestions welcome.

re musicians - been playing with a drummer and bassist, who are okay, but who probably won't do the tour. they mean well but i don't think they'll get out of their jobs. still looking for a violinist. and keys, maybe.

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Timothy Bailey & The Humans Update
</b> <br><br> Hello.

I'd apologize for sending a mass email, but then you might say, "If you were really sorry you wouldn't have done it."  And you'd be right, of course.

I thought that you all might enjoy a brief TB&TH update.  So, here goes.

1.  Lots of new songs.  About one per week.  Some good, some not, some in between.  You can hear some of the new stuff by clicking the links below.

http://www.timothybaileyandthehumans.com  (Click on the old radio)

> "Matter and the Void" is new.  It has to do with my recent (happily brief) obsession with a meteor wiping out life on Earth again.

> "East Laburnum" is new.  It's about the economically depressed area I drive through every day on my way to work.  It's also about this guy, John Stein, who used to work where I work who (TRUE STORY!) was shot at a convenience store one morning on his way to the shop.  Apparently, he stuffed a rag in the wound and worked his entire shift.  That blows my mind.  I'm not sure if it's the stubbornness, toughness, or outright foolishness that so shocks me.

> "The Blades of Death" is also relatively new.  It was inspired by a horrific accident at work about two months ago.  The title comes from the phrase we used to use at Harrison's shop whenever we used the type of machine on which my coworker was injured.

http://www.myspace.com/timothybaileyandthehumans

> "Nick and Tom" is new.  If you're not a Tom Waits or Nick Cave fan, just skip this one.  It's a loving parody, but it won't be at all funny if you're not into their stuff.

2.  I'm doing as much as I can to find a good manager for TB&TH--someone to shop demos to labels.  If you have any contacts you'd like to share, that would be very much appreciated.

3.  When are we going to play again?  I don't know.  That depends in part on Johnny's Sparklehorse tour schedule.  It also depends on public outcry, but so far, that's been pretty underwhelming. So, more about that later.

I hope this finds you all well.

I've been sending out lots of demos recently to managers and lawyers of musicians I like.  Started making follow-up calls this afternoon.  It's brutal.  It's like calling the prettiest girl in school to ask her to the prom when you absolutely KNOW what she's going to say.</br></br>

Totally forthright.  Answers his own phone.  Hadn't heard it, but said that he didn't get an overwhelming number and that he does listen and that he will call if he likes it.  Nice enough.

> George Stein (managed Jeff Buckley)

Receptionist from the Bronx?  Very unprofessional.  Didn't get to Mr. Stein himself, but she did, and she said 1) They never got my demo and 2) they wouldn't listen anyhow.  I verified the address.  Not cool.

> Amy Butterer (management associate at Neko Case's booking agency)

Left message.

> Frank Callari (manages Lucinda Williams and Ryan Adams...must have his hands full.  Also  A&R for Lost Highway)

This was the big surprise.  I didn't even ask the guy who answered the phone if I could talk directly to FC, but the guy  was super nice and said he'd definitely pass my contact info and web address to FC who would definitely listen.  This is where I anticipated the greatest snobbery but received the least.</br></br>

How far into Arrested Development are you?  Please tell me the exact last episode you watched.  Oh man, we love that show.

I've attached a Christmas present.  Last year I covered one of your songs on Christmas.  I can't believe that was a year ago.

i've never heard it before but my pilgrimage to the mighty oracle Google cryptically suggests it's either james taylor or sarah mclaughlin.

it's a really really good song. weird. see, these shmaltzmeisters keep surprising me by coughing up good songs now and again. c.f. neil diamond, et al. at first i thought it might be skynyrd or something just based on the chord progressions. or procol harum.

hey, have i sent yo uthe new grb record yet? i can't remember. if not, supply an address.

i've only seen a couple of arrested development episodes, which is why i'm thinking about plowing through tomorrow. i feel retarded as is. it's like saying i've never seen the simpsons.

2006 has been weird for movies. it's all backloaded. there's like seven i want to see right now. including casino royale. i saw apocalypto the other day, and while it's not deep, it's kinda cool. also saw volver and half-nelson thanks to the screeners my landlady gets for being in the screen actors guild. score a point for hollywood.

my feeling is that if sparklehorse can be a viable band, tbandthehs should have no freaking problem. that is my feeling. i live near the capitol records building, so if you want me to drop off a cd, just say so. i'll even vouch for you.

i have met a girl here who so blows my mind. now i am scared shitless that i won't be able to win her over.

Speaking of B.O.T.T. and N.C., she covered "Buckets of Rain" when I saw her in Charlottesville.

I had a pedal steel player over the other day to record a track on one of my songs.  Kinda interesting, but not entirely what I'd hoped for.

sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you on this.
i haven't burned thru AD yet. keep yr pants on. i will. instead i fell asleep watching lord of the rings. which was nice. that movie is sort of comfort food.
as for this woman, she is named juliette. she goes to my church. she's really pretty and everything, but you realize quickly when you live in l.a. that pretty is common. what blows my mind is her freaking brain. she's so smart and she can dork out about all my favorite literary theory but in a way that she means it. she's a brilliant, clear, concise writer. she's in the early half of her 20s which bothers me a little, not that you'd know it from talking to her. and she has just way better taste in music than me. she's schooled me hard on bob dylan since i admitted i didn't really know that much about him. (which, DUH. where have i been? seriously.) and she knows obscure van morrison stuff, and her and her roommate watched the last waltz the other night with great enthusiasm, and of course it goes on and on. plus she's really no-bullshit and not impressed with the whitewashy parts of faith. she gets it, in a hundred different ways. but she can also be sort of quiet, pensive, and it's hard to know what she's thinking or feeling. i know she likes me as a person, but i can't tell if she likes me more than that. and maybe it's a bad idea to get involved with someone not yet 25. but i've been trying to think if i've ever met anyone like her and no one comes readily to mind.
i have to admit, i'm a little hung up on her. which scares the shit out of me.
oh man, and i forgot to mention what a great look she has. boy is that dumb. but she has the ability to turn me on by wearing a long grey skirt and chucks. there is nothing sexier than a long skirt. really. ostentation is easy, mystery is hard. i don't think she's even trying either. or not much.
ugh.
i'm doomed.
fuck. i hate this.

That sucks about the tour.  Why is the business side of the music industry so filled with fuck-ups of that sort?

Things are so-so because Chesley is having a hard time.  She, like me, has a long history of mental illness and a lot of it comes from similar sources.  Namely, horrible abuse of all kinds at the hands of parents/step-parents/teachers as well as a long family history rife with insanity.  She is seeing Jean, my therapist in DC who was so extremely helpful to me, and I think that will be good for Chesley.  She's been to lots of mental health professionals, but the sad fact is that most aren't all that skilled.  Anyway, the basic triggers for her craziness are 1) PMS combined with 2) minimal conflict.  It's pretty bad.  The thing is, I love her, and by that I mean I'm willing to extend myself for her benefit regardless of how I might be feeling emotionally.  That's pretty much my definition of love, and I'm okay at it for the most part, but I can get worn down and become less able to do it as well as I'd like.  And that's where things are today.  I've kind of needed some room to regroup, and that's been hard for her.  If there's good news in any of this, it is this: I feel sane and strong in myself--stable.  Which is amazIng for me and very gratifying in an odd way.

Scott Crowder does seem like a great guy, and I like his songs a lot.

<b> Jan 6, 2007, at 5:42 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> Hey -

Cool, I like DLR (not to be confused with the *other* DLR: Diamond David Lee Roth). That guy Scott is a great guy. Where are you playing?

My new booking agent bailed without booking our March tour, which I would get upset about if I hadn't secretly kind of expected it. I think it might work out anyway since I'm probably teaming up with this band Gutbucket to do it. We'll see. I'm actually not that worked up about it.

Things with Juliette took a weird turn on New Year's Eve. I went to an early party (played the new Nintendo Wii with some grown adults - that thing is outta control) and then drove out to hang with her and her roommate and this guy John who Juliette has a fake band with. It was really really fun at first. She was in rare form. But then sometime after midnight I was in the kitchen talking with the roommate (who may kinda have a thing for me, hard to tell) and I went to take a leak and Juliette was kinda cuddled up with John, head in his lap. Granted she was drunk. Still. We sorta swapped some email about it afterwards in which she called her relationship with John "complicated." I'm pretty sure it means that he has it bad for her and she doesn't have it so bad for him, but either way it was kind of heartbreaking in a way that's probably disproportionate to what circumstances would actually warrant. I felt like total shit. I guess I'm a sucker. I'm not really angry, but I think that maybe - dazzling though she is in many ways - she's just not a grownup. I should probably have known. I dunno. She seemed pretty together. I haven't totally written it off but i'm definitely back in my corner of the ring.

Why are things so-so?

</b> <br><br> So I was out having a beer with my boss and a coworker the other night.  At a T.G.I.F.

My boss was educated by jesuits, and it shows in stuff he says, like this question he posed:

"Do you believe that God could create a rock so enormous that if He rolled it down a hill He could not stop it?"

If you let that sink in, you may not sleep tonight.  I told him the next day that it had troubled me.  He said it had been troubling him for 35 years.</br></br>

did have that drink with ricky. had quite a few drinks with ricky. it ended up in a complex theological debate, but before that it was good but also a little depressing. he kinda feels at the end of his rope. he kept talking about middle age. his on-again off-again relationship with (uh, that girl he's been involved with for 14 years whose name i forget) was really over. he was talking seriously about joining the army. he also has a wicked coke habit. the funny thing, though, is even though he was bummed about all this shit he's such a fun guy to hang around with and talk to. and he's really really honest about his weaknesses and failings. he really seems to want to be a good guy but has no will. i actually had a great time hanging out with him.

Other favorite sounds of mine include the vibraphone, and a couple of the synths including sanur shimmer and rotuma bells (or something to that effect).

The AU effects are the same as those in Logic, which is pretty amazing.</br></br>

I'm listening now.

> Good gracious this thing sounds good.  I'm on Track 3.  Who finished it after Chad bailed?

> If Lujo doesn't make this a priority, they're nuts.  I'm not just saying that to be nice.

> More overtly religious material than before?

> "The Joke."  Dead on.  Geez.  Kind of a soul number in a way.  Which is funny, when one thinks of the (at least outward) soullessness of the Ann Taylor set.  Phenomenal drum sounds: those fills!  The falsetto at 2:58.  Goddamn.

> Acoustic guitar in "Hope."  Have you ever recorded with an acoustic guitar before?  I can't remember hearing one before in your stuff.  It's nice how they alternate left and right.  HOLY SMOKES, is that flat-out rock 'n roll at 2:12?

You know, I just don't know what I'd compare GRB to if somebody asked.  It's like maybe a little AMC, but also The English Beat.  I don't know.  It really could/should inspire a very dedicated cult.

> The particular chord voicings you use in the intro of "The Dead President's Wife" are very characteristic of your "thing."  Cool suspensions and whatnot, like lots of weird major 6th chords and stuff.

> I never was a Husker Du fan, but I know that you are.  I've never heard it in your stuff, though, but I do here.

>  Surprising guitar solo in "Johnny Hears June."

> I like what ended up happening with "These Windows."  I think I heard an early demo of it.

> "Mercy" is a perfect way to end this.  This is a flat-out christian rock record at least in the way that "The Joshua Tree" was.  It's brave to do this.  It also just feels right.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready /  Bob Massey's Friend/Potential IP Representation
</b> <br><br> Hello Elizabeth,

 
Bob Massey is a close friend of mine, and earlier today when I ran a potentially thorny intellectual property situation by him, he suggested that I contact you immediately.  I may need help from an entertainment attorney, and soon. 

 
I hope it's not premature to give you a thumbnail sketch the of the issue, but I don't want to waste any time.  Basically, a former band mate of mine, Michael Hearst, may be attempting to profit (or may already have profited) from  works for which we share the copyrights.  See the text of his email below: 

 
Also, I've just signed a publishing deal with Mute Song.  It's for
non-US only.  I figured I'd just give them everything I've ever been
part of musically and let them keep it all in their catalog... just in
case.  Of course, if anything Schwa is ever in a position to be used,
I will certainly check with you first for approval.  And If there is
any money to collect, I would collect for both of us, and then pay you
50%.  Is this okay by you?

 
I responded with two emails, which follow.

 
EMAIL 1

I'd need to be written into any deal involving any song for which I hold the copyright along with you and which is registered in our names with BMI.

 
EMAIL 2

 
The more I've thought about this, the more I want to express discomfort.  Unless Mute Song wants to extend some kind of arrangement towards me independently, I am not at all comfortable with them "keep[ing] it all in their catalog." 

This is non-negotiable.

 
I've heard nothing in response, and I'd prefer that any further communication with Mr. Hearst come from a lawyer. 

 
Additionally, Mr. Hearst has lately approached me about posting our old bands' catalog on iTunes.  I've been going along amiably with the plan thinking that there was practically zero likelihood that anybody would ever buy any of the songs.  He had said he'd pay me 50% of the proceeds, and I didn't think much of it.  In light of today's email, however, I am concerned that I too readily agreed.  I would very much like him to cease and desist with regard to any plans to sell any of the music for which we share the rights. 

 
 Is this something with which you could help me, and if so, how would you bill for your services?

 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 
Best,

 
Tim McCready

<b> Jan 18, 2007, at 6:12 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> i would without doubt get something on paper and legally binding that holds mute to it. no aspersions on anyone's character, but i've been inadvertently screwed on things like this.

this is my friend elizabeth's email. elizabeth@reputationmusic.com. she is an entertainment lawyer. she was also in several notable indie bands. she gets it and she's a bulldog for artist rights. i would email her immediately and say i sent you. if i were in this situation, i would want her on my team.

it would be good to have your songs with mute, but you want that split on paper for sure.</br></br>

<b> Jan 18, 2007, at 9:36 PM / Elizabeth Elmore, Esq. / </b> <br><br> Hi Tim - 
 
Thanks for getting in touch. I'm not sure if I'll be able to help out or not, but we can at least discuss it. I'm actually very busy with work for other clients right now, and I'm in the process of interviewing for full-time jobs. I've heard of schwa, so I'd also need to make sure I don't have any connections with Michael (conflict of interest issues, etc.) Just so you know, I charge $50/hour and bill in 1/6 of an hour increments. 
 
First of all, how recent were your emails to Mr. Hearst? I can't give you any legal advice until I'm officially retained as an attorney, but musician to musician, you might consider contacting Mute Song directly. I wouldn't be antagonistic, just let them know that you're putting them on notice that Mr. Hearst is not the sole owner of the copyright and that any deal would have to go through you as well. Assuming you're open to doing a deal with them, I'd express that to them and just reiterate that you wanted to make sure your legal right to any profits was protected. ITunes might be a bit harder, just because it's such a corporate behemoth. Regardless, I agree that you need to be legally a part of any deal that happens if you're part owner of the copyright. 
 
Hope that's at least a little bit of help! I'm somewhat swamped right now with work, but I'm hoping things ease a bit next week. So we can definitely stay in touch about this.
 
Thanks,
Elizabeth

</b> <br><br> Hello Elizabeth,

I've just had a productive discussion with David McGinnis at Mute Song (00 44(0)20 8964 2001).  He was appropriately concerned, but also set my mind somewhat at ease about some of the salient issues.

The fact remains, however, that Michael did complete a deal with Mute Song including works for which I'm part owner of the copyright, consulting me only ex-post-facto.  I am concerned that whatever advance he received was predicated on this misrepresentation, and I'd like to be appropriately remunerated.

I am extremely concerned about his posting our shared works on iTunes until this is all hammered out.  I honestly do appreciate what it's like to be swamped with work and interviewing for jobs, but I do wonder if you could compose a letter to Michael telling him to cease and desist with regard to putting any shared works for sale?  If not, can you refer me to someone who could?

Best,

<b> Jan 22, 2007, at 12:40 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Better, thank you.  Friday night was very, very bad.  Chesley said things about herself and about me that were excruciating to hear.  Basically, I believe she has such a huge amount of pain and self-loathing built up from years of horrible treatment at the hands of people who should have taken care of her that she simply has no idea what to do with it all.  When it comes close to the surface, she'll do or say anything to get away from the pain, including telling me she hates me, never loved me, that I'm disgusting, and on and on.  It was heartbreaking because I pretty well knew what was happening, but I'm human, and it hurt a lot, too.  She spent most of Saturday in a kind of fog, mostly in bed.  We saw Jean yesterday in D.C., which was helpful.  Chesley remembered very little of what she actually said Friday night.  Anyway, things got much better thanks to Jean's help.  It was good for Chesley to hear how bad off I was at my lowest points in therapy with Jean--I'm not sure she's ever believed it when I've told her how low I'd been.  I think Chesley may need to spend a few months in the hospital day program I was in several years ago for abuse survivors--I think it would give her a head start in dealing with stuff she just can't face.  I have no idea how that would work practically--financially, geographically.  I don't know.  I love her and am committed to her and I believe she can get better.  It will be reassuring when the day comes that she believes likewise.

On another subject, thank you for the referral to Elizabeth; I think she's going to help very skillfully with the Mike Hearst issue.

I'm home from work today.  Woke up around 1:00 freezing to my very core and gagging mightily like I was going to throw up for what seemed like an eternity.  Woke up with a fever which has since subsided.  It's the third time in the last few weeks that this kind of thing has happened, so I've been lying around all day.  I went to the doctor who pretty much freaked me out by saying that it sounds like gall bladder disease.  I think I'd rather not have gall bladder disease, thank you.

</b> <br><br> Better, thank you.  Friday night was very, very bad.  Chesley said things about herself and about me that were excruciating to hear.  Basically, I believe she has such a huge amount of pain and self-loathing built up from years of horrible treatment at the hands of people who should have taken care of her that she simply has no idea what to do with it all.  When it comes close to the surface, she'll do or say anything to get away from the pain, including telling me she hates me, never loved me, that I'm disgusting, and on and on.  It was heartbreaking because I pretty well knew what was happening, but I'm human, and it hurt a lot, too.  She spent most of Saturday in a kind of fog, mostly in bed.  We saw Jean yesterday in D.C., which was helpful.  Chesley remembered very little of what she actually said Friday night.  Anyway, things got much better thanks to Jean's help.  It was good for Chesley to hear how bad off I was at my lowest points in therapy with Jean--I'm not sure she's ever believed it when I've told her how low I'd been.  I think Chesley may need to spend a few months in the hospital day program I was in several years ago for abuse survivors--I think it would give her a head start in dealing with stuff she just can't face.  I have no idea how that would work practically--financially, geographically.  I don't know.  I love her and am committed to her and I believe she can get better.  It will be reassuring when the day comes that she believes likewise.

On another subject, thank you for the referral to Elizabeth; I think she's going to help very skillfully with the Mike Hearst issue.

I'm home from work today.  Woke up around 1:00 freezing to my very core and gagging mightily like I was going to throw up for what seemed like an eternity.  Woke up with a fever which has since subsided.  It's the third time in the last few weeks that this kind of thing has happened, so I've been lying around all day.  I went to the doctor who pretty much freaked me out by saying that it sounds like gall bladder disease.  I think I'd rather not have gall bladder disease, thank you.  I've got a morning of tests next week to find out.

Et vous?</br></br>

today i got this weird call from this producer guy -- maybe i should say "producer" since, like, everyone around here says they're a producer -- who was interested in having me adapt a new yorker article for film. he's a referral from another writer friend of mine who's working on something for him already. so i kind of trust that he's on the level but i don't know him and there are many many questions. it's not much dough upfront, either, which he was very candid about. but i'm now considering whether i can knock out a feature draft in two weeks, since that's about all of my time his thousand clams is gonna buy him.

i'm looking for the link to the actual new yorker story, but here's an nyt blurb about the same guy (i think this is the guy, the producer dude is supposed to email me the article - which i read when it came out) :

Supported by a cane and wearing shackles, a 91-year-old man pleaded guilty in federal court to robbing an Abilene bank in August. The man, J. L. Hunter Roundtree, faces 20 years in prison in the robbery, which netted $1,999. It was his third bank robbery in five years. In December 1998, he was arrested in Biloxi, Miss., minutes after he robbed a bank. He was given three years' probation. In October 1999, he was arrested after robbing a bank in Pensacola, Fla., and sentenced to three years in prison. Asked then what he would do when he got out, Mr. Roundtree said: ''I might rob another bank. I'm not saying I will or I won't. But, hey, I might need to.''

another great quote:

"You want to know why I rob banks? It's fun. I feel good, awful good. I feel good for sometimes days, for sometimes hours," Rountree once said in an interview with The Associated Press.</br></br>

VA MUSICIAN TIMOTHY BAILEY REACHES FINALS OF 
INTERNATIONAL SONGWRITING COMPETITION

Widely respected competition features high-profile music industry judges.

Richmond, Virginia musician Timothy Bailey has reached the final round of the 2006 International Songwriting Competition (ISC).  The ISC is an annual songwriting contest whose mission is to provide the opportunity for both aspiring and established songwriters to have their songs heard in a professional, international arena.  Over 14,000 songwriters from across the globe competed in the current ISC, which the New York Times has called “The songwriting contest to take note of.”  High-profile music industry insiders including grammy winner Tom Waits, founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson, rock pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis, and U2 producer Steve Lillywhite comprise the competition’s judging panel.  

Bailey resumed writing songs in late 2005 after a 10-year hiatus from the music world.  His main songwriting concern is how people attempt to maintain a realistic sense of hope in the face of life's myriad difficulties.  Recent recordings, including those entered in the ISC, show a hard-won maturity and measured optimism arising from a personal reckoning with life’s low points.  Of the six songs Bailey submitted to the ISC, NUMBER were selected for the final round.  The winners of the 2006 ISC will be announced in March, 2007.

More information about Bailey is available at his band’s web site, timothybaileyandthehumans.com as well as that of the ISC, songwritingcompetition.com.  Timothy Bailey and The Humans’ debut recording, “Ecoutez! Ecoutez!” is available for purchase at Apple’s iTunes Music Store.  “Ecoutez! Eouctez!” includes three of Bailey’s ISC entries.

i am SO GLAD that things are better. much prayer was spoken. how did things come to simmer down?

i'm still wrangling with the guy over the new yorker script idea, but i've read it and i think it can be done. i don't have enough info at present to make it faithful to the actual relationships in the story, but the producer guy thinks he can get that info. also, i told you the wrong bankrobber initially. different old guy bankrobber. i'll attach the story.

the trick is to present it in a way that the studios can't say no. which means i have to have a strong theory about why he did what he did, and that theory should probably be rooted in his family and/or romantic relationships. so that's what i'm pondering now.

that and whether i can afford to do it.

things = reasonable. 

i'm stringing along the bank robber screenplay producer guy to make him think  my ideas about it are indispensable, because his offer utterly sucks, monetarily, so i want him to give me more dough before i'll do it.

also about to work the full-court press to option this book, "love is a mixtape," by rob sheffield. he's the brother in  law of my friend joe. his book caused me to laugh out loud repeatedly and also to weep repeatedly. it's about his wife who died in front of him aged 31 of a pulmonary embolism, and their love story is told almost entirely through the prism of mix tapes they made for each other. guy can fucking write like no one's bizness.

last night i watched xanadu. holy shit is it bad. i knew that but still i watched it. then i went on a little imdb.com frenzy w/r/t xanadu. i include my findings here:

according to imdb:

budget: $20m
gross: $10.2m

OUCH.

nominated for a Razzie Award: "worst 'musical' of our first 25 years"

turns out the director, robert greenwald, has recently done some indies and a lot of docs: "steal this movie," "wal-mart: the high cost of low prices," and "iraq for sale: the war profiteers."

about the screenwriters:
richard christian danus has one other credit, from 1986. some tv episode.
marc reid rubel has a couple of credits but nothing this decade.

Trivia
• 
The old building that became Xanadu was the Pan Pacific Auditorium on Beverly Boulevard, near CBS's Television City in Hollywood, California. It was built in 1935 and was destroyed by a fire in 1989. A community center now sits on the site, featuring a single version of the Pan Pacific's 4 curved deco spires
• 
The set of the Xanadu club cost $1,000,000 to build.
• 
Gene Kelly took the part of Danny McGuire because filming was a short drive from his Beverly Hills home and he could be close to his family at the same time.

Remake of
	•	Down to Earth (1947)



some amazing notes about michael beck (sonny):

"'the warriors' opened a lot of doors in film, for me, which 'xanadu' then closed."

Andy Gibb was originally cast to play Sonny.

imdb user notes:

The other day I went to see Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469/) and in one of the scenes, Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are watching a tape called 'Lord of the C**k Rings' and Val Kilmer says something like "This movie stars someone named Michael Beck, whoever he is..." 

!!!!! I couldn't believe it!!! It actually showed him on the television screen they were watching.
----------------------
It was a bit of trickery on the directors part. The clip was actually some old LA Law footage with Corbin Bernsen mixed with some footage of Beck from a movie he did (I'm not sure of the movie itself). It's mentioned in the commentary on the new DVD. The scene and the XANADU line were meant as a little in-joke to the producer of KISS KISS, Joel Silver. XANADU was one of his earlier producing credits.</br></br>

<b> Feb 7, 2007, at 7:24 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> very very true. there were like six top ten hits off that soundtrack. it's burned into my gray matter thanks to my folks' car's 8-track player. i'm ashamed to admit i'll probably download the entire soundtrack. cliff richard is also on it. 

the soundtrack is pretty much why i watched it again. i also subjected my friends anthony and jess to it. it's like the producers spent $19,999,987.50 on the music and visuals and $12.50 on the script.

if you can find a copy you should totally watch it. gene kelly totally kicks everyone else's ass. and he's 68 in this movie. also, ON-J is super hot.</br></br>

I got a response from Lujo today to the second demo they had requested.  I must have sent that thing five months ago, and they never answered my follow-up emails.  That's understandable--I can only imagine how much craptastic email they must receive.  Anyway, Stephen Guidry said that he was passing it along to everybody else with the recommendation that they give it a serious listen.  So, who knows?  Thing is, I don't see how my stuff really fits in with what they do.  But the attention feels nice all the same.

TB&TH played a party last weekend, and man was it ever weird.  I don't think I'm doing that anymore.  Bunch of architects who hadn't seen each other in a long time.  I don't think they disliked us, but I do think we may have been distracting them from their conversations.  That's totally fair; I might feel the same way in similar circumstances.  Thing is, we totally kicked ass.  Oh well.

"Director's Suite."  Sheesh!

I've long been struck by the discrepancy between the cost of making a movie and that of making an album.  I mean, with a heavy promotion budget and the whole nine, what does a new Justin Timberlake album cost?  A couple of million?  Five million?  Surely not a whole lot more than that.  But a movie...well, that's another matter.  I wonder if old Mitch Easter has a "Producer's Suite" at his Fidelitorium Studio?  I doubt it.

Architects.  Not so much with the togas.  But plenty of highbrow blah-dee-blah.

I think you should write two movies.

The first one is about how we became friends through email at the advent of the technology.  It should be very goofily retro.  I'm mostly kidding about this, since probably everyone thinks they should have a movie made of some aspect of their lives when really, they shouldn't.

The second one is the one you sketched in your email.  The white collar/blue collar moviemaking experience.  It's hilarious.  Strikingly so.

We'll see about Lujo.  I am most definitely NOT holding my breath.</br></br>

today is just endless bullshit girl drama. worked-up email from cate about something that has nothing to do with me; lunch with juliette wherein i realized it's hard to treat someone like a friend when you are totally in love with a lot of things about them.

friday i got to go to the warner bros lot where cate's helping mix the sound on this movie. it's on this massive soundstage that can only be compared to the bridge of the uss enterprise. huge theater-sized movie screen, a 100-ish channel board, all automated, with a screen for every eight channels, six protools stations with guys manning three of them, then a couple of huge leather couches and recliners in the capt spock / mr chekov positions. the director's suite is behind - imagine a hotel room with sunny veranda, big screen tv, kitchen, everything's catered. it was NUTS.

then i drove over to the valley to help a pal pick up gear for a short film he's shooting. it was like the yin and yang of hollywood. from snooty white collar to hungover blue collar. we loaded my van up with light stands and clamps and crates and whatnot. the contrast was hilarious.

the dudes working the boards at wb were pretty old skool and one dropped in they hadn't seen for 20 years. they were trying ot think of the last time they'd seen each other, and they were like, "oh yeah, it was for 'redux,' right? you remember how we stored all those sound elements over at [wherever]? well, somehow they lost them. the only reason that film got recut and remastered was because [someone] found copies of the sound elements in a trash can in a warehouse in london." what they were talking about, i learned, was 'apocalypse now.' they had last worked together on the director's cut, but they had also worked on the original. and someone in the studio system just LOST all the sound effects and shit somehow.

in. sane.</br></br>

Bob Massey here, from The Gena Rowlands Band. How goes it?

I'm putting together a tour for May to support the release of our third CD, "Flesh and Spirits," which comes out April 10 on Lujo Records (www.lujorecords.com). 

Our lineup includes Eric Axelson and Jason Caddell, both formerly of The Dismemberment Plan; Jean Cook, also of Beauty Pill, Ida and Jon Langford's band; David Durst, who's played with Maritime and others; and me.

In the past we've toured with Andrew Bird, Enon, The Dismemberment Plan and others.  

Ideally we'd love to play

Kindly give me a holler as soon as you can. Thanks!

The Gena Rowlands Band
310-621-5809 / bob@genarowlandsband.com
HYPE FOR THE GENA ROWLANDS BAND:
“It's tragic, hilarious, brilliant writing.”
    --Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
 
“A stunner.”
    --Miami New Times
 
“Every song is great.”
    --Houston Press
 
“The former Telegraph Melts member has pointed his latest project’s arrows at Hollywood and the way movies cause us to perceive the world and our place in it… La Merde et Les Etoiles (French for "Shit and the Stars", if I read it correctly) is so unified a work of brooding ghost cabaret miserablism you could practically call it a concept album, though the term is a little strong for a record with no overarching narrative. The music could qualify as chamber pop if it had any pretense of wanting to be pop-- instead the violas, vibes, clarinets, and cellos drift along behind Massey's wine-stained baritone, forming a sort of stream-of-consciousness backdrop that drifts in and out of dissonance, occasionally dissolving to a minimalist wisp.”
   --Pitchfork, rating 7.1
 
“Musically kaleidoscopic, simultaneously lush and choppy, this ambitious experiment succeeds on pretty much every level.”
   --Splendid</br></br>

</b> <br><br> No.  You should headline.  We're playing two weeks before that at G5, so I expect our draw may be somewhat more limited than it would be otherwise.  I mean, otherwise its' just enormous...  Actually, this all makes me wonder if TB&TH should play at all or if we should find someone who will bring in more people.  

I actually don't know the people at G5.  P.J. does this kind of stuff for me, and my guess is that he'd be thrilled to help book a GRB show.  You should definitely email him at richmondrawk@hotmail.com.  Yes, do that.  Then let me know what he says.  If he can't help, I'll get it done.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I've not been there myself, but I hear it's a nice venue.  PJ has played there.  It seems to me (and I could be wrong) that bands which can't manage a show at Starr Hill (where Neko Case et al play) play there.  They have a MySpace profile which you could check out.  

Very, very, VERY few indie bands of merit are coming through Richmond anymore.  Way fewer than 10 or 12 years ago when you could see a Wilco or a Pavement at least once a month.  I can't think of the last time a band I'd heard of and wanted to see played a show here.      Even Sparklehorse skipped us, and they're from here for goodness sake.  That having been said, the shows I've seen at Gallery 5 (the only game in town now) have been reasonably well attended.  We're playing there because we have no other choice in Richmond, but I have some minor reservations about the P.A.  Not very rock 'n roll of me, but I care about hearing myself sing.

My understanding, and this is all second-hand info, is that there's a smarter, more informed indie-rock aficionado scene in Charlottesville.  On the other hand, if PJ gets behind a GRB show in RVA, he will do everything humanly possible to beat the drum, and I'll help.

I would be happy to play either way.  I would not publicize my involvement in a Richmond show until after April 27 because I'm concentrating hard on making that a success.  Even so, two weeks to push a GRB/TB&TH bill should be fine.  I don't know if I'd do it solo or with the band.  Same goes for Charlottesville, but either way, I'd totally be there.</br></br>

<b> Mar 13, 2007, at 12:26 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> actually i haven't asked jason. but i might. it's just four shows on the east coast. me, jean, durst, eric and vin. same people who recorded the album.</br></br>

<b> Mar 27, 2007, at 8:26 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> i was researching "guilty pleasures" in the attempt to find something funny to write a screenplay about (got any ideas?) and i found this, which i knew i had to share with you:

Roger Scruton, philosopher, journalist
Elvis
Although I argue vehemently against modern pop music, on grounds of its musical incompetence, verbal impoverishment and general morbidity, narcissism and salaciousness; although I fiercely object to disco dancing as a sacrilege against the human form and a collective rejection of civilised courtship; although I defend reels, minuets, galliards, sarabands and (as limiting cases) waltzes and polkas as the only ways in which ordinary humanity should dare to put its sexual nature on festive display, and although I regard the 12-bar blues and the flattened subdominant seventh as the lowest forms of vulgarity in music, I find rock'n'roll in general, and Elvis in particular, irresistible, and would happily dance away the night to it. I cannot explain the thrill of delight with which I hear the first bars of Jailhouse Rock or the eagerness with which I at once search the vicinity for a partner: but there it is, appalling proof that, despite all my efforts, I am human.</br></br>

<b>  March 29, 2007 at 4:18:00 AM PDT
 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: awesome
</b> <br><br> That is one amazing quote.  A good movie might be just having someone repeat this over and over for two hours.  I don't think it would get old!  Especially if Bill Nighy was the actor.

You know what does get old?  Constant sickness.  I woke up at 1:00 Tuesday morning, projectile vomited all over the house, then alternated puking and diarrhea for the next 12 hours.  Plus a fever, horrid cramps, and incredible body aches.  THEN, Chesley woke up at 1:00 this morning with the same damn thing.

So, here's a screenplay idea for you:

> Husband gets sick with minor cold

> Wife sick with flu for 10 days

> Wife develops serious subcutaneous infection in leg, requires surgery and attention of wound specialist

> Husband gets Noro virus, pukes guts out

> Wife gets Noro virus, pukes guts out

> Husband and wife are intermittently depressed/mildly psychotic throughout

> Missed work precipitates financial crisis

> Nonetheless, their intense love for one another prevails</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Inspired by that Quote
</b> <br><br> Sometimes I feel this way.  Not always.  Just sometimes.

Everything about rock bands seems tired, irrelevant, and old.  I’m tired of seeing four or five young men looking sullen and introspective in a black and white photograph.  I’m also tired of the photos in which they’ve all jumped a few inches off the ground, smiling.  I’m tired of hearing melodies draped over simple, boring chord progressions.  I’m tired of the tricks people use to gussy-up their insipid melodies and boring chord progressions.  I’m tired of 4/4 time, and I’m tired of people playing in odd meters because they’re tired of 4/4 time.  I’m especially tired of hearing bands interviewed on the radio.  I just can’t stand it when they sound like snotty punks (that’s tired), and I can’t stand it when they come across as articulate and reasonable (that’s boring).  I’m sick of the compact disc as a physical object.   I’m sick of the grovelling that most musicians do to attract the attention of some failed musician who runs a record label.  I’m tired of bands’ unwittingingly hilarious attempts to make themselves seem like a bigger deal than they know they honestly are (e.g., “Our drummer is in Sparklehorse.”)  There is no romance left anymore in the notion of driving around the country in a rotting van, sleeping on floors, playing to empty rooms.  Possibly the most boring thing is the bitterness that ensues when one isn’t photographed, interviewed, lauded, or asked to play in rooms that aren’t empty.  Bitterness is definitely boring.  But then, so is optimism, a la “Everyone has to get started somewhere” or “If we get our name out there enough, people will come to our shows.”  People won’t come to your shows, and why should they?  They already have the entire form of your performance hardwired into their brains before they pay the cover. You offer them absolutely nothing new or edifying.  Guitars, bass, drums, keyboards: Boring.  Add something clever like a hurdy gurdy or a violin: That’s boring and predictable in its attempt to overcome the boredom.   Irony?  Incredibly dull.  I saw the Palace Brothers cover a John Cougar Mellencamp song twelve years ago, and I was bored then.  Sincerity?  More boring still. Singing like a poor imitation of Bjork over the strains of a nauseating harp?  Silly and boring.  Have you ever seen Men Without Hats' "Safety Dance" video?  Do you recall how foppishly silly it seemed?  Well, there's practically zero distance between that and, say, Pavement, or GOD FORBID! Arcade Fire's lead singer smashing an acoustic guitar on Saturday Night Live.  Reunion tours are boring.  Destroying stuff is boring.  Playing "unplugged" is boring.  You know what's both boring AND tedious?  Funny songs, like those sung by Bare Naked Ladies.  That brings up band names, which are universally boring.  Take for instance the resurgence of the "X and the X's" genre.  Timothy Bailey AND the Humans.  Boring.  Ted Leo AND the Pharmacists.  Boring.  Antony AND the Johnsons.  Boring AND boring AND boring!  

And so on.</br></br>

Perfectly apropos of laughing at "rockers," no?  I don't know the treadmill reference.

You know I was mostly kidding about all that stuff, right?  Walker Percy and Shelby Foote would periodically include the most scathing assessments of themselves and their chosen career in their correspondence.  The funny thing is, for some reason Chris Bopst writes a column every week now which--I swear I'm not exaggerating--sounds almost exactly like all that vitriol.

Barfing has ceased.  Now it's just a lot of body aches and sour looks, like those in the attached photo taken this afternoon.

I didn't find Lindsay Lohan cosmically boring the other day when I was banging her.

I didn't just say that.  I really didn't.

It's okay, I'm going to confession tomorrow.

No, that doesn't make it okay.

The truth is I didn't bang her.

It's the fever.

i think you forgot the whole riff about silly videos, a la ok go. sure everyone loves the silly synchronized dances, and then loves the treadmills, and then loves the wallpaper thing. but it's boring. all of it. and obvious. because the song is obvious and a retread and elvis costello did it way better 30 years ago.

although, to be fair, the treadmill thing still makes me laugh. but laughing at rockers is so boring.


yesterday i rode around with a friend who works as a paparazzi. man, speaking of boring. i mean, for me it was interesting. but on a cosmic scale what could be more boring than lindsay lohan?
okay, actually it was pretty fascinating although not much happened. man, the wealthy people in this town are just freaking disgusting. all that rodeo drive crap is pathetic and disturbing.

how's the barfing?
i think someone like peter jackson could have made something of that story, back before he did LOTR and got all famous. ever see DEAD ALIVE? it was kind of a gross slasher flick he did, but it was funny and weird. he could have made something of a barfing love story.</br></br>

<b> Mar 31, 2007, at 5:43 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Hi Bob,

Chesley and I just came up with a movie idea for you.

It's about a quirky middle-class couple who idle away the time concocting absurdly small-time heists.

For example, they take a crappy guitar in a really crappy case to Sam Ash (or wherever).  The check-in guy makes a note of what they carry in, and they tell him they're looking for a new case.  They switch out the crappy guitar with a much nicer one, keeping the same crappy case.  Then, when they walk out, they tell the check-in guy they couldn't find a case to fit their guitar.  He doesn't even think to look in the crappy case again.  The thing is, it'd be funniest if they stole a guitar only marginally nicer than the original.

Maybe that's too specialized, so...

The couple cases out a Zales or some other relatively-low-end mall jewelry store.  They surreptitiously photograph a tacky diamond studded heart pendant or something that they really like.  They go home and make a fairly good replica of it in their master-thieves' workshop.  Then they go in, pose as an interested couple, create a diversion, make the switch, then say, "No...afraid it's out of our price range."  All this for something that's worth maybe $700.

It's kind of like The Jerk, only with criminals.  Married criminals.  It's a buddy movie with married Jerk-like criminals.

Anyway, I hope you're having a nice weekend.

<b> Mar 31, 2007, at 11:18 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> this is actually a really hilarious idea. it's not a whole movie, but it's some part of a movie for sure. i love the tiny little scams. what might happen to them to shake up their comfy little scheme?

maybe they meet a really big scammer? or they get scammed? or they meet someone they're sure is also scamming but s/he's not, it's more like magic tricks for amusement?

in case yr bored, here's my new romantic comedy. feel free to offer suggestions if/when you get around to reading it.

</b> <br><br> Bob,

I just finished your screenplay.  I don't feel in any way qualified to comment on it.  I am struck by the gap between the words on a page and a finished movie--so much would depend on how certain aspects of it were played, like how broadly the actors carried the comedy.

Okay, so even though I have no basis for legitimate criticism...

1.  I laughed throughout.

2.  The basic premise is entertaining.

3.  It seems like it could be a big-time romantic comedy with big stars.

4.  I think Claire needs a bit more development; perhaps a little more (albeit subtle) vulnerability to make her truly villainous.  It would be nice to have some hint of why she is the way she is.  Maybe also nice to see that she knows exactly why she is that way, but chooses villainy rather than, like, growth or whatever.  What I'm getting at is that if she's really corrupt, she ought to know she's doing wrong.  I also wonder if she should come across as less of a bitch (and more of a blank slate) at the very beginning because Max is an intelligent, thoughtful guy, and I'm not sure he'd go for an outright ball-crushing bitch, no matter how hot.

7.  It seems like a smart, canny move to write a romantic comedy about romance novels.  Get the hordes of people who read that stuff to come see your film.

I hope, but doubt, that there's something useful in the above.

Best,

Tim</br></br>

<b> Apr 10, 2007, at 5:57 PM / Bob / </b> <br><br> thanks for reading this thing. it's REALLY interesting to get feedback from a civilian. plus i like that you now have an idea what my line of work (ostensibly) is like, good and bad. 

screenplays are really weird animals. you're kind of not allowed to dictate details of the filmic vision, since that's a director's turf. yet you're expected to convey this vivid story in a way that they can "see" it. ridiculous. so for me on a script like this most of the creativity goes into the dialogue. this thing is almost the precise opposite of the music i do, and yet some of the same skills come to bear. 

anyway. i think your notes about claire are right on. that seems to be a growing consensus. so i'm gonna tackle that on the next pass. the implants scene could, i think, make me laugh depending on who's doing it, but it's kind of a little experiment for me. because some people read this and think the humor isn't broad enough (read: dumb and obvious enough), to this scene is kind of my little litmus paper i'm going to use to calibrate my humor against prevailing popular humor - or at least, i'm gonna try. it's basically exactly the kind of tone as that infamous scene in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. so we'll see. almost everyone has an opinion, one way or another, on it.

Giving people like those your screenplay to read must feel at least a little like giving a label a demo, especially a demo they've asked for.  I find that much harder than when I just send one cold because it creates more of an expectation that they'll like it.  I'm glad to hear that the movie business is more of a meritocracy.  That's good.</br></br>

Tomorrow night, Friday, April 27th, Timothy Bailey & The Humans will play with Dark Little Rooms and Liza Kate at Richmond's Gallery 5.  Doors open at 7:00 PM with music beginning around 7:30.

Nashville artist Bryce McCloud has printed a beautiful poster for the event, a black-and-white mockup of which is reproduced below.  Bryce has done work for Marianne Faithful, Bob Dylan, Gillian Welch, and many others.  Posters will be for sale at the show for a mere $5.  Proceeds from the sale of posters will benefit Bryce's studio, Isle of Printing.  Oddly, Bryce and I decided that the poster should include a portrait of Kurt Vonnegut about 10 days before he died.

For more details about tomorrow's show, including MapQuest directions to the venue, please visit http://www.timothybaileyandthehumans.com, and click the "Shows" link.

i had this whole long indulgent (on my part) convo with cate last night about how rimbaud (the poet) became an arms dealer. i became convinced, in a flash of metaphoric insight, that after a short intense career of trying to reach ordinary people with his poetry, he finally got to the end of his rope and said "okay, you're more interested in money and warfare and fashion than in poetry? fine, i'll give you what you want at last." and he started selling bullets to those very people he'd dreamed of winning over so they'd kill themselves off more quickly.

</b> <br><br> Hey Bob,

I just read a really interesting article in "The Atlantic" and thought of you.  It's about scam-baiting, the practice of counter-conning Internet con-men.  Some of it was uproariously funny.  Some troubling.  Anyway, I thought you'd be interested AND that it seemed potentially cinematic.

Speaking of which, have you had a chance to take a look at the Museum of Jurassic Technology book yet?

Are these periodic suggestions useful/amusing/welcome or just annoying?

-- Tim</br></br>

<b> May 4, 2007, at 12:49 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Bob,

The scam baiters are basically Internet vigilantes, I suppose. They respond to those Nigerian-despot-with-a-million-bucks-type emails, stringing along the scammer for long periods of time.  Sometimes they send the scammers to banks two hundred miles away which turn out not to exist.  One guy told the scammer that he (the scam baiter) worked for a company that did handwriting analysis and that they would pay the scammer $30 per page of handwriting.  The scam baiter then induced the scammer to copy BY HAND an entire Harry Potter novel.  Likewise, one of these guys cooked up a story about being part of some foundation sponsoring up and coming sculptors and convinced a scammer to carve a reproduction Commodore 64 out of wood.  The story in "The Atlantic" delves into the ethics of all this, which was compelling, but I was more moved by the nerdy hilarity and inventiveness of some of the counter scams.  Since I love heist stories, I thought this sounded like the basis for some kind of international confidence game movie.  It would be awesome if the scammer who made the wooden computer ended up with a one man show at the Tate Gallery or something (Chesley's idea).

Have you met the love of your life in the last hour and five minutes?  I hope so.

I'll see if I can find that bread recipe and email it to you.  It's amazing.

Things here are okay.  Chesley's been kind of down for the last few days, but seems to be feeling a bit better today.  Work is still slow, but not as slow, and consequently I'm less miserable than I was a week ago.  I'm trying to write a song about Prometheus without sounding like a complete blowhard.  Money is a problem.  I'm increasingly aware of my own mortality, which is really weird and startling.  Thank God It's Friday, though.  

Best,

i started the jurassic tech book last night but then passed out. not because of the book. because of all the wine i drank. i bet that book is awesome but i don't remember.

the POS hasn't changed much yet. but i think i need to redo the first act. i'm awaiting verdicts from a few people before i make any moves on it. also i have other work i have to do.

a producer hired me to rewrite this period romantic adventure thing. it's an interesting challenge. basically anything i turn in will be better than the original. so i got that going for me. it's possible i could make real money on the back end, too, if it gets funded and goes into production. we shall see. hard to predict.

basically i'm writing my ass off over the next six to nine weeks. plus some grb shows in there. i have nothing especially dramatic to report at present. perhaps today i'll meet the love of my life. that will make for an awesome email tomorrow.

</b> <br><br> Yes, the TI-99 is a nice looking machine.  I couldn't remember it, but that's what Google Image search is for.

When I say I'm thinking about my mortality, I'm totally serious.  A few weeks ago I had chest pains with extreme shortness of breath a couple of evenings.  I had it checked out, and everything is fine with my heart, but it really brought something home to me that I'd hitherto kept pretty much at arm's length, namely, that I AM going to die.  I mean, of course it's obvious, but even despite my intense suicidality several years ago, I'd never really felt it in my gut.  A lot of thoughts have flowed from the experience.

Flavored fizzy water, huh?  Not rasberry, I hope.  Because that is officially gross.</br></br>

the fire was pretty weird. you could see it from my front porch. it didn't quite make it to my neighborhood but they evacuated people close to the park. i drove by silver lake reservoir, which is where i run all the time, and helicopters were swooping down, hovering inches off the surface, sucking up water, then swooping off to dump on the fire. also, EVERYONE was out on the sidewalk watching the fire spread. people were concerned. after dark it got really surreal, with the flames and the orange smoke clouds and stuff.

reports vary on the guy they caught. some say he didn't start it, some say he's not being cooperative. most say it was from a cigarette on the golf course.

i've spent a lot of time in that park. it's gonna be really weird with no trees. what a bummer.</br></br>

It was a thrill to see GRB last night.  It's uncanny how well I know those songs--they're totally embedded in my mind.  I almost jumped up onstage to sing "Kong Meets His Maker," as if it were a Guided By Voices show, but my better judgment prevailed.

Since I've  not seen you play live much, I haven't ever really noticed what an idiosyncratic guitarist you are.  You make use of very distinctive voicings.  Usually, when I watch someone's fingers I  can ascertain what they're playing, but not so with you.  It's cool.  Likewise, that's an amazing cast of players you've assembled.  I knew that Vin was phenomenal, but wasn't prepared for the sheer awesomeness of Eric's bass playing.

I wish we could have spent more time hanging out and that Chesley could have made it, but I'm glad we got to spend the time together that we did.

Best,

Tim</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Hi Erik,

I'm writing again to ask if you've had a chance to listen to my demo.  I really am sorry if this amounts to pestering you--I truly do understand and appreciate how many demos you must receive.

I'm in the very early stages of planning to go ahead and start recording a full-length CD with my friend Jason Caddell.  Besides the music itself, I think his involvement as well as that of other friends from well-known bands would present a unique selling point.

The budget I'm anticipating for this project allows for recording, mastering, pressing, printing, PR, and radio promotion.  If it comes to it, I'll make up a label to release it under, but obviously, I'd rather it be released under the aegis of an established label like yours.

Again, recognizing that you're very busy, I'd very much appreciate your thoughts about this.

Best,

Tim

<b> May 22, 2007, at 4:52 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I'm glad to hear it.  I wish I could have been at the D.C. show as well as the Fredricksburg one, but we had Roz's wedding that afternoon, and it would have been too much for me.  When you say you lost a shitload of money, what are you talking about?  I hope it's in the hundreds, not thousands.

Did I tell you that I've decided to sell my Ryan McGinness paintings and make/promote a record?  Tom Waits, Bono, and Charles Bukowski are MAKING me do it.

Below is an email I received from Erik Aucoin this morning.  It seemed like really good news to me, especially since I'm already planning on paying for recording and PR.  Your analysis would be most welcomed.

Hey Tim we did listen to it and we were very impressed.  Jason is a good friend and a great producer.  We'd love to hear what you record with him.  We're not in a position to sign a new band and pay for them to go into the studio (I'm sure you know that Bob has paid for his own recording on both his albums while we covered pressing, PR, ads, etc).  But please send us mixes as you get them and if you are interested we can consider the album and can talk further.

Erik</br></br>

<b> May 22, 2007, at 5:34 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> All of that is sobering information and advice.  Sheesh.  Is what I do a "project band?"  The personnel have varied each time we've played, and that's likely to continue to a certain extent.  Is there really any other way once you're no longer in your early twenties?  The thing is, I'm kind of interested in just having a label's imprimatur on the thing, paying for all of it myself.  Is this misguided?

I'm hoping to get about $25k for the pair of paintings.  That's a couple thousand more than the last appraisal which was done by his gallery in New York.  If you're saying "Holy Shit" to yourself right now, then rest assured you're having the same reaction I had when I got those documents in the mail.  Obviously, I've considered the wisdom of selling these now for less than $30k when it's not altogether unlikely that in a decade or two they could net over a million.  But, here's the thing: Would I rather gamble on Ryan's career or my own?  When I put it to myself that way, it has exactly nothing to do with money.  All that, plus I do have some other paintings and assorted flotsam and jetsam.

Have you seen the video for Nick Cave & TBS's "Nature Boy?"  It's just a plain-old rock song with a plain-old video, but damn is it satisfying.  Who else could mention a woman quoting Sappho in the original Greek and make it sound so freaking cool?  I found it on YouTube, where else?

I hope you do tour more.  I'd like to see that shit again, yo.</br></br>

Did I tell you that I've decided to sell my Ryan McGinness paintings and make/promote a record?  Tom Waits, Bono, and Charles Bukowski are MAKING me do it.

Below is an email I received from Erik Aucoin this morning.  It seemed like really good news to me, especially since I'm already planning on paying for recording and PR.  Your analysis would be most welcomed.

Hey Tim we did listen to it and we were very impressed.  Jason is a good friend and a great producer.  We'd love to hear what you record with him.  We're not in a position to sign a new band and pay for them to go into the studio (I'm sure you know that Bob has paid for his own recording on both his albums while we covered pressing, PR, ads, etc).  But please send us mixes as you get them and if you are interested we can consider the album and can talk further.

</b> <br><br> All of that is sobering information and advice.  Sheesh.  Is what I do a "project band?"  The personnel have varied each time we've played, and that's likely to continue to a certain extent.  Is there really any other way once you're no longer in your early twenties?  The thing is, I'm kind of interested in just having a label's imprimatur on the thing, paying for all of it myself.  Is this misguided?

I'm hoping to get about $25k for the pair of paintings.  That's a couple thousand more than the last appraisal which was done by his gallery in New York.  If you're saying "Holy Shit" to yourself right now, then rest assured you're having the same reaction I had when I got those documents in the mail.  Obviously, I've considered the wisdom of selling these now for less than $30k when it's not altogether unlikely that in a decade or two they could net over a million.  But, here's the thing: Would I rather gamble on Ryan's career or my own?  When I put it to myself that way, it has exactly nothing to do with money.  All that, plus I do have some other paintings and assorted flotsam and jetsam.

Have you seen the video for Nick Cave & TBS's "Nature Boy?"  It's just a plain-old rock song with a plain-old video, but damn is it satisfying.  Who else could mention a woman quoting Sappho in the original Greek and make it sound so freaking cool?  I found it on YouTube, where else?

I hope you do tour more.  I'd like to see that shit again, yo.</br></br>

<b> May 22, 2007, at 8:11 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> That's good news. Erik wouldn't say that if he didn't mean it. He's not shy about blowing off bands. I can tell you what he does NOT want: bands who don't make back the money spent to promote them. He cut all those bands from his label already. Which means he expects bands who aren't just project bands, and he expects bands that tour. So consider your plans before proceeding. 

How much can you get for those paintings? Do you have to sell all of them? If you had, say, ten grand you could record and promote a record (if someone else paid for pressing) and still have a couple grand to lose on tour. I'd try to hang on to some of those paintings if I were you. You might want to make more than one record, if nothing else.

As for my losses, it's like $400 for the plane ticket, $300 for the minivan, probably $150 for gas and tolls, whatever I spent on food in DC, $100 for a new guitar case since my old one got smashed by the airline. So say a thousand bucks. And I split the proceeds (about $350) with the players. And I sold 22 CDs for a net of $110 on sales. 

If i'd had a money show -- like at a college -- then it could have worked out. Or if I sold a lot more merch. Or borrowed a van. Or something.</br></br>

<b> May 22, 2007, at 8:42 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> It's a project band if you rarely or never tour, basically. Personnel doesn't matter that much if it revolves around you. I've been riding the fine line and have been feeling the pressure to ramp it up. 

Of course, if your records sell in large enough quantities, no one makes a fuss. But since I'm assuming you'll have to fight for sales, Erik will expect touring since that's how his bands sell the most records.

And so, start cultivating whatever connections you may have to try and open for some bigger band on tour. Because, as we both know, the other kinds of tour tend to suck.

I'm not saying don't sell both paintings, but if you only need to sell one right now, then hang onto the other. Because you never know. And cash tends to disappear.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Dream
</b> <br><br> I wanted to tell you about this dream I had night before last.  It's the second Tom Waits dream I've had.

____________________________________________

I'm at Tom and Kathleen's house up around Ashland.  We're sitting in the living room.  I look out the sliding glass doors and see strange animals with luminescent fur walking in the air about 12 feet above the ground.  They're about the size of donkeys but look like a cross between irish wolf hounds and leopards.  In the dream, this is every bit as strange as it would be in waking life.

Tom and Kathleen take me on a tour of their land.  Mostly it looks like the woods would look in Ashland, but there's one section that appears to be Mediterranean coast.  They tell me this is the North Anna river, which seems odd.

Back in the living room, about a dozen eight- or nine-year-old asian children dressed as buddhist monks materialize in a semicircle on the floor.  Tom, Kathleen, and the children speak some kind of mystical incantation and I am put into a bizarre hypnotic state somewhere between death, sleep, and ecstasy.

I go home.  While there I become afraid that perhaps there's something evil about what had happened.  I go back to the Waits/Brennan household.   We have this conversation:

Me: Are you maguses? (That's what I say in the dream--not magi.)

T&K: Yes, we are.

Me: Do you do this for Satan?

T&K:  Nah, we pretty much just do it for fun.

THE END

</b> <br><br> I hear you.  It really was uncanny.  

Like I said, this is the second one.

The first one was way less magical-realist.  In it, Tom Waits and I are sitting around in his living room just talking about records and stuff.  It was very comfortable.  The relationship felt kind of like mine with Harrison--a close friendship with someone twenty some odd years older inevitably has a shadow of mentorship.  The second Tom Waits dream was emotionally powerful in that I felt lots of wonder, then fear, then relief.  The first one was as comforting as spending an afternoon with a good friend.

Somewhere I read Mark Linkous's account of meeting Tom Waits in person for the first time.  Waits had picked him up at the airport in a big old Suburban.  Somehow they got to talking about their mutual disdain for turkey vultures.

Did I ever send you that "Nick and Tom" song I did, the parody?  I'd sent that to Jeff Abarta, the head of A&R at ANTI- with a big note written on the envelope that it was not a demo, that it was a parody, and that I didn't want anything from him.  After a month or so I got in touch with him through MySpace to see if he'd gotten it.  He had and he said it made him laugh.  I thought about sending him the dream from Monday night, but I don't want to give anybody the creeps.</br></br>

On the other hand, "40 Odd Years" is kind of appealing because it makes you sound like you're somewhere in your 60's, which is cool.

I'm home today feeling craptastic.  My boss is unhappy with me.  Not sure what my deal is.  I literally dozed off while standing at my workbench this morning and could barely drive home.  Bad sleep, I guess.  Really bad.

I've decided to sell my Ryan McGinness paintings and record/promote a record.  It's a big, life-changing kind of decision.  Hopefully I'll find a label willing to distribute it when it's done.  I have one strong possibility for that right now.  My friend Jason Cadell in D.C. is going to produce.  I want everyone to play on it, so you can look forward to an assignment!</br></br>

Dave: For some weird reason, the David Lee Roth morning radio show (now defunct). DLR replaced Howard Stern's time slot at KROQ after "the king of all media" made the jump to satellite radio. I'm not sure, but I don't think that David Lee Roth had too many credentials other than the fact that he was a wacky personality that used to tear shit up in the 80's as the frontman of Van Halen, but for some reason KROQ thought it would be a great idea to give him a daily weekday show at 6 in the morning.

Don't get me wrong, this show totally sucked ass in a major way. I used to show up to Battles practice and bitch about how lame the show was that morning. I used to want to call in to the show to tell him how much I thought he was the shit when he was in Van Halen and how much he totally sucks now. His jokes were wicked lame, his stories made absolutely no sense, his whole staff sucked, and he would play really lame music while he talked over it. I totally hated this show, it was like listening to a car crash every morning. It only lasted for a couple months, and as the show got older and people kept calling in and doggin' DLR, the higher-ups at KROQ started to take more stuff away from him, he could no longer play that lame music while he talked; they took away his staff and replaced it with a super-dry Australian guy that had absolutely no chemistry and nothing in common with DLR. Towards the end he was a defeated man; he was fired and the show was taken off the air.However, almost a year and a half has gone by, and, in retrospect, I now realize that David Lee Roth was really trying to push some boundaries, and as much as his show may have sucked, he really managed to, for better or worse, strike a chord with me. I started to feel bad for him towards the end of the show, I felt how he realized that there could be something better than your average "Mike and the Mad Dog" type shit and he strived for something outside of the box, and the higher-ups cut him back down to size. Thus, DLR is my, in recent memory favorite radio show, he was a man that stood up for mankind and held a mirror up to those fat corporate cats sitting in their cushy office chairs in their safe well-constructed glass boxes that they work within and in a way, said, I dare you to challenge the state of this dystopian society that we've created for ourselves. DLR was, to your average plumber in New Jersey, unsuccessful in his attempt at being a radio show host, but to the artist that dwells within all of us, he was a beacon of light.</br></br>

<b> May 24, 2007, at 5:41 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i just think the answer this guy gave is hilarious. i'm not sure if he's serious or not. but i kind of think he might be.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> The other possible exception to the no-chorus rule is the jazz guitarist Mike Stern.

There, those are my two cents.

Good night.</br></br>

<b> May 24, 2007, at 7:17 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> wtf??

was that from 'nite flite' or some shit?

i think chorus on a guitar should equal instantaneous death.</br></br>

<b> May 24, 2007, at 7:39 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> huh. i wonder what he's got going on with that? laneys aren't that expensive, right? but custom les pauls...

i probably owned a chorus pedal at some point, along with a lot of other unnecessary shit.

one exception to my no chorus rule: i think the guy from damn near red used one but it came off more like a delay somehow. i never could figure out how he did that. that guy was kind of a genius that way.</br></br>

Nick Cave's Love Song Lecture
Read on September 25, 1999 in Vienna.

To be invited to come here and teach, to lecture, to impart what knowledge I have collected about poetry, about song writing has left me with a whole host of conflicting feelings. The strongest, most insistent of these concerns my late father who was an English Literature teacher at the high school I attended back in Australia. I have very clear memories of being about twelve years old and sitting, as you are now, in a classroom or school hall, watching my father, who would be standing, up here, where I am standing, and thinking to myself, gloomily and miserably, for, in the main, I was a gloomy and miserable child, "It doesn´t really matter what I do with my life as long as I don´t end up like my father". At forty years old it would appear that there is virtually no action I can take that does not draw me closer to him, that does not make me more like him. At forty years old I have become my father, and here I am, teaching.

What I wanted to do here was to talk a bit about "the love song", to speak about my own personal approach to this genre of songwriting which I believe has been at the very heart of my particular artistic quest. I want look at some other works, that, for whatever reason, I think are sublime achievements in this most noble of artistic pursuits: the creation of the great love song.

Looking back at these twenty years a certain clarity prevails. Midst the madness and the mayhem, it would seem I have been banging on one particular drum. I see that my artistic life has centered around an attempt to articulate the nature of an almost palpable sense of loss that has laid claim to my life. A great gaping hole was blasted out of my world by the unexpected death of my father when I was nineteen years old. The way I learned to fill this hole, this void, was to write. My father taught me this as if to prepare me for his own passing. To write allowed me direct access to my imagination, to inspiration and ultimately to God. I found through the use of language, that I wrote god into existence. Language became the blanket that I threw over the invisible man, that gave him shape and form. Actualising of God through the medium of the love song remains my prime motivation as an artist. The love song is perhaps the truest and most distinctive human gift for recognising God and a gift that God himself needs. God gave us this gift in order that we speak and sing Him alive because God lives within communication. If the world was to suddenly fall silent God would deconstruct and die. Jesus Christ himself said, in one of His most beautiful quotes, "Where ever two or more are gathered together, I am in your midst." He said this because where ever two or more are gathered together there is language. I found that language became a poultice to the wounds incurred by the death of my father. Language became a salve to longing.

Though the love song comes in many guises - songs of exultation and praise, songs of rage and of despair, erotic songs, songs of abandonment and loss - they all address God, for it is the haunted premises of longing that the true love song inhabits. It is a howl in the void, for Love and for comfort and it lives on the lips of the child crying for his mother. It is the song of the lover in need of her loved one, the raving of the lunatic supplicant petitioning his God. It is the cry of one chained to the earth, to the ordinary and to the mundane, craving flight; a flight into inspiration and imagination and divinity. The love song is the sound of our endeavours to become God-like, to rise up and above the earthbound and the mediocre.

The loss of my father, I found, created in my life a vacuum, a space in which my words began to float and collect and find their purpose. The great W.H. Auden said "The so-called traumatic experience is not an accident, but the opportunity for which the child has been patiently waiting - had it not occurred, it would have found another- in order that its life come a serious matter." The death of my father was the "traumatic experience" Auden talks about that left the hole for God to fill. How beautiful the notion that we create our own personal catastrophes and that it is the creative forces within us that are instrumental in doing this. We each have a need to create and sorrow is a creative act. The love song is a sad song, it is the sound of sorrow itself. We all experience within us what the Portugese call Suadade, which translates as an inexplicable sense of longing, an unnamed and enigmatic yearning of the soul and it is this feeling that lives in the realms of imagination and inspiration and is the breeding ground for the sad song, for the Love song is the light of God, deep down, blasting through our wounds.

In his brilliant lecture entitled "The Theory and Function of Duende" Frederico Garcia Lorca attempts to shed some light on the eerie and inexplicable sadness that lives in the heart of certain works of art. "All that has dark sound has duende", he says, "that mysterious power that everyone feels but no philosopher can explain." In contemporary rock music, the area in which I operate, music seems less inclined to have its soul, restless and quivering, the sadness that Lorca talks about. Excitement, often; anger, sometimes: but true sadness, rarely, Bob Dylan has always had it. Leonard Cohen deals specifically in it. It pursues Van Morrison like a black dog and though he tries to he cannot escape it. Tom Waits and Neil Young can summon it. It haunts Polly Harvey. My friend and Dirty 3 have it by the bucket load. The band Spiritualised are excited by it. Tindersticks desperately want it, but all in all it would appear that duende is too fragile to survive the brutality of technology and the ever increasing acceleration of the music industry. Perhaps there is just no money in sadness, no dollars in duende. Sadness or duende needs space to breathe. Melancholy hates haste and floats in silence. It must be handled with care.

All love songs must contain duende. For the love song is never truly happy. It must first embrace the potential for pain. Those songs that speak of love without having within in their lines an ache or a sigh are not love songs at all but rather Hate Songs disguised as love songs, and are not to be trusted. These songs deny us our humanness and our God-given right to be sad and the air-waves are littered with them. The love song must resonate with the susurration of sorrow, the tintinnabulation of grief. The writer who refuses to explore the darker regions of the heart will never be able to write convincingly about the wonder, the magic and the joy of love for just as goodness cannot be trusted unless it has breathed the same air as evil - the enduring metaphor of Christ crucified between two criminals comes to mind here - so within the fabric of the love song, within its melody, its lyric, one must sense an acknowledgement of its capacity for suffering.

In Lou Reed´s remarkable song "Perfect Day" he writes in near diary form the events that combine to make a "Perfect Day". It is a day that resonates with the hold beauty of love, where he and his lover sit in the park and drink Sangria, feed animals in the zoo, go to a movie show etc., but it is the lines that darkly in the third verse, "I thought I was someone else, someone good" that transforms this otherwise sentimental song into the masterpiece of melancholia that it is. Not only do these lines ache with failure and shame, but they remind us in more general terms of the transient nature of love itself - that he will have his day "in the park" but, like Cinderella, who must return at midnight to the soot and ash of her disenchanted world, so must he return to his old self, his bad self. It is out of the void that this songs springs, clothed in loss and longing.

Around the age of twenty, I stared reading the Bible and I found in the brutal prose of the Old Testament, in the feel of its words and its imagery, an endless source of inspiration. The Song of Solomon, perhaps the greatest love song ever written, had a massive impact upon me. Its openly erotic nature, the metaphoric journey taken around the lovers bodies - breasts compared to bunches of grapes and young deer, hair and teeth compared to flocks of goats and sheep, legs like pillars of marble, the navel- a round goblet, the belly- a heap of wheat - its staggering imagery rockets us into the world of pure imagination. Although the two lovers are physically separate - Solomon is excluded from the garden where his beloved sings - it is the wild, obsessive projections of one lover onto another that dissolve them into a single being, constructed from a series of rapturous love-metaphors.

The Song of Solomon is an extraordinary love song but it was the remarkable series of love song/poems known as the Psalms that truly held me. I found the Psalms, which deal directly with relationship between man and God, teeming with all the clamorous desperation, longing, exultation, erotic violence and brutality that I could hope for. The Psalms are soaked in suadade, drenched in duende and bathed in bloody-minded violence. In many ways these songs became the blue-print for much of my more sadistic love songs. Psalm 137, a particular favourite of mine and which was turned into a chart hit by the fab little band Boney M. is a perfect example of all I have been talking about.

The love song must be born into the realm of the irrational, absurd, the distracted, the melancholic, the obsessive, the insane for the love song is the noise of love itself and love is, of course, a form of madness. Whether it be the love of God, or romantic, erotic love - these are manifestations of our need to be torn away from the rational, to take leave of our senses, so to speak. Love songs come in many guises and are seemingly written for many reasons - as declarations or to wound - I have written songs for all of these reasons - but ultimately the love songs exist to fill, with language, the silence between ourselves and God, to decrease the distance between the temporal and the divine.

In Psalm 137 the poet finds himself captive in "a strange land" and is forced to sing a song of Zion. He swears his love to his homeland and dreams of revenge. The Psalm is ghastly in its violent sentiments, as he sings for love of his homeland and his God and that he may be made happy by murdering the children of his enemies. What I found, time and time again, in the Bible, especially the Old Testament, was that verses of rapture, of ecstasy and love could hold within them apparently opposite sentiments - hate, revenge, bloody mindedness etc. that they were not mutually exclusive. This idea has left an enduring impression on my songwriting.

Within the world of modern pop music, a world that deals ostensibly with the Love Song, but in actuality does little more that hurl dollops of warm, custard-coloured baby-vomit down the air waves, true sorrow is not welcome. But occasionally a song comes along that hides behind its disposable, plastic beat a love lyric of truly devastating proportions. "Better The Devil You Know" written by hitmakers Stock, Altkin and Waterman and sung by the Australian pop sensation Kylie Minogue is such a song. The disguising of the terror of Love in a piece of mindless, innocuous pop music is an intriguing concept. "Better The Devil You Know" is one of pop music's most violent and distressing love lyrics.

Say you wont leave me no more
I`ll take you back again
No more excuses, no no
Cause I´ve heard them all before
A hundred times or more
I´ll forgive and forget

If you say you´ll never go
Cause it's true what they say
Better the devil you know
I know, I think I know the score
You say you love me, O boy
I can´t ask for more
I´ll come if you should call

When Kylie Minogue sings these words there is an innocence to her voice that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling. The idea presented within this song, dark and sinister and sad - that all love relationships are by nature abusive and that his abuse, be it physical or psychological, is welcomed and encouraged, shows how even the most innocuous of love songs has the potential to hide terrible human truths. Like Prometheus chained to his rock, so that the eagle can eat his liver each night, Kylie becomes love's sacrificial lamb bleating an earnest invitation to the drooling, ravenous wolf that he may devour her time and time again, all to a groovy techno beat. "I´ll take you back. I´ll take you back again". Indeed. Here the Love Songs becomes a vehicle for a harrowing portrait of humanity not dissimilar to that of the Old Testament Psalms. Both are messages to God that cry out into the yawning void, in anguish and self-loathing, for deliverance.

As I said earlier, my artistic life has centered around desire or more accurately, the need, to articulate the various feelings of loss and longing that have whistled through my bones and hummed in my blood, throughout my life. In the process I have written about two hundred songs, the bulk of which I would say, were love songs. Love songs, and therefore, by my definition, sad songs. Out of this considerable mass of material, a handful of them rise above the others as true examples of all I have talked about. Sad Waters, Black Hair, I Let Love In, Deanna, From her to Eternity, Nobody's Baby Now, Into my Arms, Lime Tree Arbour, Lucy, Straight to You; I am proud of these songs. They are my gloomy, violent, dark-eyed children. They sit grimly on their own and do not play with the other songs. Mostly they were offspring of complicated pregnancies and difficult and painful births. Most of them are rooted in direct personal experience and were conceived for a variety of reasons but this rag-tag group of love songs are, at the death, all the same thing - life lines thrown into the galaxies of the divine by a drowning man.

The reasons why I feel compelled to sit down and write love songs are legion. Some of these came clearer to me when I sat down with a friend of mine, who for the sake of his anonymity I will refer to as J.J. and I admitted to each other that we both suffered from psychological disorder that the medical profession call erotographomania. Erotographomania is the obsessive desire to write love letters. My friend shared that he had written and sent, over the last five years, more than seven thousand love letters to his wife. My friend looked exhausted and his shame was almost palpable. I suffer from the same disease but happily have yet to reach such an advanced stage as my poor friend J. We discussed the power of the love letter and found that it was, not surprisingly, very similar to the love song. Both served as extended meditations on ones beloved. Both served to shorten the distance between the writer and the recipient. Both held within them a permanence and power that the spoken word did not. Both were erotic exercises, in themselves. Both had the potential to reinvent, through words, like Pygmalion with his self-created lover of stone, one's beloved. Alas, the most endearing form of correspondence, the love letter, like the love song has suffered at the hands of the cold speed of technology, at the carelessness and soullessness of our age. I would like to look, finally, at one of my own songs that I recorded for The Boatman's Call album. This song, I feel, exemplifies much of what I´ve been talking about today. The song is called Far From Me.

For your dear, I was born
For you I was raised up
For you I´ve lived and for you I will die
For you I am dying now
You were my mad little lover
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
You are so far from me
Far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me

I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face
And you´d retreat from the front of your eye
I keep hearing that you´re doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast
You who are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me

There is no knowledge but I know it
There´s nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It´s good to hear you´re doing so well
But really can´t you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
Did you ever care for me?
Were you ever there for me?
So far from me

You told me you´d stick by me
Those were your very words
My fair-weather friend
You were my brave-hearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
So far from me
Far from me
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea
Far from me
Far from me

Far From Me took four months to write, which was the duration of the relationship it describes. The first verse was written in the first week of the affair and is full of all the heroic drama of new love as it describes the totality of feeling whilst acknowledging the potential for pain - for you I'm dying now. It sets the two lovers it describes against an uncaring world - a world that fucks everybody over - and brings in the notion of the physical distance suggested in the title. Strangely, though, the song, as if awaiting the "traumatic experience" that I spoke of earlier to happen, would not allow itself to be completed until the catastrophe had occurred. Some songs are tricky like that and it is wise to keep your wits about you when dealing with them. I find quite often that the songs I write seem to know more about what is going on in my life than I do. I have pages and pages of fourth verses for this song written while the relationship was still sailing happily along. One such verse went:

The Camellia, The Magnolia
Have such a pretty flower
And the bells of St. Mary's
Inform us of the hour

Pretty words, Innocent words, unaware that any day the bottom would drop out of the whole thing. Love songs that attach themselves to actual experience, that are a poeticising of real events have a peculiar beauty unto themselves. They stay alive in the same way that memories do and being alive, they grow up and undergo changes and develop. A love song such as Far From Me has found a personality beyond the one that I originally gave it with the power to influence my own feelings around the actual event itself. This is an extraordinary thing and one of the truly wondrous benefits of song writing. The songs that I have written that deal with past relationships have become the relationships themselves. Through these songs I have been able to mythologize the ordinary events of my life, lifting them from the temporal plane and hurling them way into the stars. The relationship described in Far From Me has been and gone but the song itself lives on, keeping a pulse running through my past. Such is the singular beauty of song-writing.

Twenty years of song-writing has now past and still the void gapes wide. Still that inexplicable sadness, the duende, the saudade, the divine discontent persists and perhaps it will continue until I see the face of god himself. But when Moses desired to see the face of God, Exodus 33, 188, he was answered that he may not endure it, no man could see his face and live. Well, me, I don´t mind. I `m happy to be sad. For the residue, cast off in this search, the songs themselves, my crooked brood of sad eyed children, rally round and in their way, protect me, comfort me and keep me alive. They are the companions of the soul that lead it into exile, that safe the overpowering yearning for that which is not of this world. The imagination desires an alternate and through the writing of the love song, one sits and dines with loss and longing, madness and melancholy ecstasy, magic, joy and love with equal measures of respect and gratitude. The spiritual quest has many faces - religion, art, drugs, work, money, sex - but rarely does the search serve god so directly and rarely are the rewards so great in doing.</br></br>

It's funny.  When I was a kid and listening to all kinds of new things, I'd make snap judgments, then stick by them.  So, I heard The Birthday Party, hated them (probably because they touched something too painful to contend with then), and more-or-less dismissed Nick Cave.  Chesley is a huge fan and introduced me to "The Boatman's Call" within our first couple of months of dating.  I honestly think it is one of the greatest records I've ever heard, and I've since come to appreciate more and more of his stuff.  He's the real deal, and this essay only cements his stature in my pantheon of heroes.  It's so exquisitely insightful and unflinchingly honest about stuff that is simultaneously troubling and indispensable.

It's also kind of amazing that of all the people to mention by name he includes Van Morrison (who I know to be one of your leading lights), Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Tom Waits, who inhabits my dreams.</br></br>

The Psalms are soaked in suadade, drenched in duende and bathed in bloody-minded violence. In many ways these songs became the blue-print for much of my more sadistic love songs. Psalm 137, a particular favourite of mine and which was turned into a chart hit by the fab little band Boney M. is a perfect example of all I have been talking about.

The love song must be born into the realm of the irrational, absurd, the distracted, the melancholic, the obsessive, the insane for the love song is the noise of love itself and love is, of course, a form of madness. Whether it be the love of God, or romantic, erotic love - these are manifestations of our need to be torn away from the rational, to take leave of our senses, so to speak. Love songs come in many guises and are seemingly written for many reasons - as declarations or to wound - I have written songs for all of these reasons - but ultimately the love songs exist to fill, with language, the silence between ourselves and God, to decrease the distance between the temporal and the divine.

In Psalm 137 the poet finds himself captive in "a strange land" and is forced to sing a song of Zion. He swears his love to his homeland and dreams of revenge. The Psalm is ghastly in its violent sentiments, as he sings for love of his homeland and his God and that he may be made happy by murdering the children of his enemies. What I found, time and time again, in the Bible, especially the Old Testament, was that verses of rapture, of ecstasy and love could hold within them apparently opposite sentiments - hate, revenge, bloody mindedness etc. that they were not mutually exclusive. This idea has left an enduring impression on my songwriting.

Within the world of modern pop music, a world that deals ostensibly with the Love Song, but in actuality does little more that hurl dollops of warm, custard-coloured baby-vomit down the air waves, true sorrow is not welcome. But occasionally a song comes along that hides behind its disposable, plastic beat a love lyric of truly devastating proportions. "Better The Devil You Know" written by hitmakers Stock, Altkin and Waterman and sung by the Australian pop sensation Kylie Minogue is such a song. The disguising of the terror of Love in a piece of mindless, innocuous pop music is an intriguing concept. "Better The Devil You Know" is one of pop music's most violent and distressing love lyrics.

Say you wont leave me no more
I`ll take you back again
No more excuses, no no
Cause I´ve heard them all before
A hundred times or more
I´ll forgive and forget

If you say you´ll never go
Cause it's true what they say
Better the devil you know
I know, I think I know the score
You say you love me, O boy
I can´t ask for more
I´ll come if you should call

When Kylie Minogue sings these words there is an innocence to her voice that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling. The idea presented within this song, dark and sinister and sad - that all love relationships are by nature abusive and that his abuse, be it physical or psychological, is welcomed and encouraged, shows how even the most innocuous of love songs has the potential to hide terrible human truths. Like Prometheus chained to his rock, so that the eagle can eat his liver each night, Kylie becomes love's sacrificial lamb bleating an earnest invitation to the drooling, ravenous wolf that he may devour her time and time again, all to a groovy techno beat. "I´ll take you back. I´ll take you back again". Indeed. Here the Love Songs becomes a vehicle for a harrowing portrait of humanity not dissimilar to that of the Old Testament Psalms. Both are messages to God that cry out into the yawning void, in anguish and self-loathing, for deliverance.

As I said earlier, my artistic life has centered around desire or more accurately, the need, to articulate the various feelings of loss and longing that have whistled through my bones and hummed in my blood, throughout my life. In the process I have written about two hundred songs, the bulk of which I would say, were love songs. Love songs, and therefore, by my definition, sad songs. Out of this considerable mass of material, a handful of them rise above the others as true examples of all I have talked about. Sad Waters, Black Hair, I Let Love In, Deanna, From her to Eternity, Nobody's Baby Now, Into my Arms, Lime Tree Arbour, Lucy, Straight to You; I am proud of these songs. They are my gloomy, violent, dark-eyed children. They sit grimly on their own and do not play with the other songs. Mostly they were offspring of complicated pregnancies and difficult and painful births. Most of them are rooted in direct personal experience and were conceived for a variety of reasons but this rag-tag group of love songs are, at the death, all the same thing - life lines thrown into the galaxies of the divine by a drowning man.

The reasons why I feel compelled to sit down and write love songs are legion. Some of these came clearer to me when I sat down with a friend of mine, who for the sake of his anonymity I will refer to as J.J. and I admitted to each other that we both suffered from psychological disorder that the medical profession call erotographomania. Erotographomania is the obsessive desire to write love letters. My friend shared that he had written and sent, over the last five years, more than seven thousand love letters to his wife. My friend looked exhausted and his shame was almost palpable. I suffer from the same disease but happily have yet to reach such an advanced stage as my poor friend J. We discussed the power of the love letter and found that it was, not surprisingly, very similar to the love song. Both served as extended meditations on ones beloved. Both served to shorten the distance between the writer and the recipient. Both held within them a permanence and power that the spoken word did not. Both were erotic exercises, in themselves. Both had the potential to reinvent, through words, like Pygmalion with his self-created lover of stone, one's beloved. Alas, the most endearing form of correspondence, the love letter, like the love song has suffered at the hands of the cold speed of technology, at the carelessness and soullessness of our age. I would like to look, finally, at one of my own songs that I recorded for The Boatman's Call album. This song, I feel, exemplifies much of what I´ve been talking about today. The song is called Far From Me.

For your dear, I was born
For you I was raised up
For you I´ve lived and for you I will die
For you I am dying now
You were my mad little lover
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
You are so far from me
Far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me

I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face
And you´d retreat from the front of your eye
I keep hearing that you´re doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast
You who are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me

There is no knowledge but I know it
There´s nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It´s good to hear you´re doing so well
But really can´t you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
Did you ever care for me?
Were you ever there for me?
So far from me

You told me you´d stick by me
Those were your very words
My fair-weather friend
You were my brave-hearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
So far from me
Far from me
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea
Far from me
Far from me

Far From Me took four months to write, which was the duration of the relationship it describes. The first verse was written in the first week of the affair and is full of all the heroic drama of new love as it describes the totality of feeling whilst acknowledging the potential for pain - for you I'm dying now. It sets the two lovers it describes against an uncaring world - a world that fucks everybody over - and brings in the notion of the physical distance suggested in the title. Strangely, though, the song, as if awaiting the "traumatic experience" that I spoke of earlier to happen, would not allow itself to be completed until the catastrophe had occurred. Some songs are tricky like that and it is wise to keep your wits about you when dealing with them. I find quite often that the songs I write seem to know more about what is going on in my life than I do. I have pages and pages of fourth verses for this song written while the relationship was still sailing happily along. One such verse went:

The Camellia, The Magnolia
Have such a pretty flower
And the bells of St. Mary's
Inform us of the hour

Pretty words, Innocent words, unaware that any day the bottom would drop out of the whole thing. Love songs that attach themselves to actual experience, that are a poeticising of real events have a peculiar beauty unto themselves. They stay alive in the same way that memories do and being alive, they grow up and undergo changes and develop. A love song such as Far From Me has found a personality beyond the one that I originally gave it with the power to influence my own feelings around the actual event itself. This is an extraordinary thing and one of the truly wondrous benefits of song writing. The songs that I have written that deal with past relationships have become the relationships themselves. Through these songs I have been able to mythologize the ordinary events of my life, lifting them from the temporal plane and hurling them way into the stars. The relationship described in Far From Me has been and gone but the song itself lives on, keeping a pulse running through my past. Such is the singular beauty of song-writing.

Twenty years of song-writing has now past and still the void gapes wide. Still that inexplicable sadness, the duende, the saudade, the divine discontent persists and perhaps it will continue until I see the face of god himself. But when Moses desired to see the face of God, Exodus 33, 188, he was answered that he may not endure it, no man could see his face and live. Well, me, I don´t mind. I `m happy to be sad. For the residue, cast off in this search, the songs themselves, my crooked brood of sad eyed children, rally round and in their way, protect me, comfort me and keep me alive. They are the companions of the soul that lead it into exile, that safe the overpowering yearning for that which is not of this world. The imagination desires an alternate and through the writing of the love song, one sits and dines with loss and longing, madness and melancholy ecstasy, magic, joy and love with equal measures of respect and gratitude. The spiritual quest has many faces - religion, art, drugs, work, money, sex - but rarely does the search serve god so directly and rarely are the rewards so great in doing.</br></br>

It's funny.  When I was a kid and listening to all kinds of new things, I'd make snap judgments, then stick by them.  So, I heard The Birthday Party, hated them (probably because they touched something too painful to contend with then), and more-or-less dismissed Nick Cave.  Chesley is a huge fan and introduced me to "The Boatman's Call" within our first couple of months of dating.  I honestly think it is one of the greatest records I've ever heard, and I've since come to appreciate more and more of his stuff.  He's the real deal, and this essay only cements his stature in my pantheon of heroes.  It's so exquisitely insightful and unflinchingly honest about stuff that is simultaneously troubling and indispensable.

It's also kind of amazing that of all the people to mention by name he includes Van Morrison (who I know to be one of your leading lights), Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Tom Waits, who inhabits my dreams.</br></br>

Having seen you play twice with such good people, it's real hard to imagine what GRB would sound like with people who weren't as good.

I've been contacting my favorite musicians to ask if they do session work , and if so, for how much.  I have this pipe dream that when I make a record it will include some of my favorites.  It's not like they're famous or anything, at least not to most people.  I guess they're well known as sidemen.  It'll be interesting if I ever hear back from them what their rates are.

<b> May 25, 2007, at 3:16 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> if you can find his preface to one of the gospels, i forget which, it's pretty amazing too. it was for some publisher's project of issuing each of the gospels as a little tome with  prefaces by pop figures. i think bono did one too, but i'm pretty sure nick cave's kicked his ass.

early on i kinda thought nick cave was a bit of a fake, but there was enough there to draw me in, and sometimes he just either scared or moved me. i'd put "no more shall we part" up there among his greatest. i'm also a big fan of "henry's dream" for other reasons. and i really think few have topped "from her to eternity" musically.

i feel like he kind of grew into and then surpassed his public persona, if you know what i mean. kinda fake-it-til-you-make-it sort of thing. like he gradually owned up to all his less cool influences: shmaltz, love songs, bible, etc.

It's a lot to process emotionally.

I tend to be very collected and present in stressful situations, and then when it's all over, I have a rough time.

The store manager was very helpful and kind.  The paramedics came.

I don't think things like my presence are arbitrary.  People like Chesley and I seem to wind up experiencing this sort of thing more than the average person.

Poor guy, though.  He just really couldn't take it any more.

What is there to do, really, but pray?

<b> Jun 29, 2007, at 9:13 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Bob,

A long-lost friend of mine, Ari Vais, got in touch with me out of the blue yesterday.  He lived here in the early 90's--maybe you knew him?  When he lived here his best friend was this great guy named Dylan Kidd--he's the guy I told you about who encountered "Diamond Dave" in the video store he was working in.  It turns out that Dylan is having some success as a screenwriter and director in New York.  He wrote and directed that Rodger Dodger movie with Campbell Scott.   Anyway, I was wondering if you would like me to talk to Ari about a way to get the two of you in touch?  If so, let me know.  Here's a link with some stuff about Dylan: http://imdb.com/name/nm1071898/

Chesley went into a sort of dream state, got up, and approached him.

We talked about his show on Monday in Norfolk, how much his music has meant to us, and so on. Probably spent 2 or 3 minutes chatting.

I liked the Smiths an awful lot, but for Chesley, Morrissey was one of the brightest lights of her youth along with Nick Cave and Bjork. It was pretty momentous for both of us, but especially for her.

After we'd talked, he returned to his table around the corner, but when he left, he smiled and waved.</br></br>

<b> Jul 9, 2007, at 6:18 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> somewhere out there, probably on youtube, is this self-shot video he once did for 120 minutes or the cutting edge or some mtv show. in it he talks, without discernable irony, about being a genius. that made me loathe the guy for like fifteen years. and thus i missed out on some pretty amazing work. and thinking back on it, i'm convinced he was right - mainly *because* he said it without discernable irony. 

i also heard from a guy who knows him from the u.k. scene that, contrary to his self proclaimed celibacy, he screwed anything that moved. 

which is another move of genius, in a certain light (the celibacy thing, i mean).

i guess i'm saying i have no idea how to take that statement. it could easily go either way. but i think i take it as that kind of non-ironic irony that he does. nuns wear rings and unironically say they're married only to jesus, you know? and if i were gay, i'd probably co-opt that move too.

man, that's freaking interesting though.</br></br>

the latest and last harry potter isn't actually as sad as i'd been led to believe it might be. i thought it was pretty damn satisfying.

i can't help but mentally pronounce morissey's former band as "the smiffs." i think it's because i listen to steve jones's radio show a lot and he's got a really working class brit accent that makes every "th" into "ff."

women. okay, let's see.

katie - 23, just out of RISD, her dad is a nashville string arranger, she grew up friends with my pastor rebecca's family, pretty in a slightly off-kilter way, very Very VERY much the artist. way conceptual. kinda dorky. seems to enjoy some early success as a visual artist. also maybe a tiny bit entitled or something, has only just started to take care of herself on her own steam and income, and likely has some growing up to do.

timi - tiny little woman with black eyeliner, great taste in poets and songwriters (rilke, lenny cohen), 28, has wandered around to various cities doing various things, really strong believer, kind of on the quiet side, cousin to my friend rob, just moved to l.a. and thus is doing p.a. and barista work. kinda mysterious. still getting to know her.

amy - (maybe 30?) cute blonde from church, does a lot of missionary / social work in mexican labor camps. nice, funny. don't know her super well yet but she dresses great. sexy toe rings. yum.

meghan - meghan (30) is a goddamn genius. i kid you not. she's a comic and she's brilliant. monty python level brilliant. she has a comedy duo called Karla that's worth googling. man i wish you could have seen their show at the comedy central stage here. wow. it was like beckett meets sex in the city. i have a massive crush on her brain. she's cute enough and everything. redhead like me. she's maybe a litle ornery. but i figured out that she does this thing where she has these extended inner dialogues with people. so really they're monologues. but she also plays the character of you. so on occasion i've been blindsided with this anger that i'm like: wtf? but it's because she's already had the argument she wanted to have with you and she's presenting you with the conclusion. like, "well just go spend saturday with your friends then if you want to." at which point you go: "huh?" but once i figured this out, it made it pretty simple to go: "we already had this argument, didn't we? what did i say?" and then she realizes and chills out.
she's read a ton of cs lewis and the like but isn't really a believer. kind of wants to be. but believes in the same god alcoholics believe in. her words, not mine. which is sort of a problem for me and might be a dealbreaker in the end. other people come to other understandings with each other, but i need someone who will walk with me in my faith. it's very hard for me to totally relax with a woman who can't get with the deepest thing in my life.</br></br>

You know, I hear you when you say you definitely need someone with whom you can share the deepest parts of faith.  I never would have thought I'd be one of those people who could make the kind of accommodation you referred to last night, but then, it just happened.   I don't know what that is but grace, frankly.  I think you're right to hold out for what you know you want/need in a mate.

About work:  There really is this guy there (Grover (Clyde in the song)) who claims to have been killed and come back to life three times so far.  This other guy, Joe (the misanthrope) told me that Grover had said that one of the times it happened, he was just walking down the street when a wrecking ball swung out of nowhere and KILLED HIM!  He came right back, though.

One night, as Chesley and I were just falling asleep, I remembered that I had something really important to tell her.  So I told her the thing about the wrecking ball, and we were up another half hour at least, just laughing our asses off.  She wondered if the doctors who revived Grover had been to the Wylie E.

</b> <br><br> Hi Jake,

My good friend Bob Massey has mentioned several times that he thought Pete's would be a great place for my band Timothy Bailey & The Humans to play, and he forwarded me the email below this afternoon.    You can see video from a recent show at our website, http://www.timothybaileyandthehumans.com.  Also, if you click the old radio, an MP3 player will open, but the video is more representative of what we're doing now than the MP3's.  

In any case, if you're interested, I'd be very proud to play at Pete's on either 8/18 or  8/31.  Because it's somewhat short notice, I'm not entirely certain what our lineup would be, but at a bare minimum I could play solo.  

Please let me know your thoughts!

Best regards,

Tim McCready

</b> <br><br> Bob,

This sounds like it'll be something.  Wow.  

I have sent a small donation via PayPal--please let me know when you receive it.  I had to correct some banking information, and I want to be certain the money reaches you.

Before you go, I'd like to know if you'll encounter any of the Naga people (most are christian now), and if so, if you  might remember to ask some of the elder folks about my grandfather.  Also, my father went on a medical mission trip to India about three years ago, and if you have any interest in talking to him about it, I'm sure he'd be happy to.

This is a big deal.  

Take care,

Tim</br></br>

so yeah, that's what i've been up to.

also wooing a lady named emily from church who fucking rules. she's someone i've know for a long while but she kinda just recently dawned on me. i guess i learned more about her backstory and discovered she's a secret badass.

<b> Aug 16, 2007, at 4:57 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> DISTURBING FACTS YOU PROBABLY DIDN’T KNOW: 27 million people are enslaved today. That’s more than before slavery was legally abolished worldwide. Modern-day slavery is a $31 BILLION enterprise. Most of the slaves are women and children.
 
Hey there, it’s Bob.
 
Guess what? I’m going to India. This is true. In October I’ll be traveling to the more-or-less opposite side of the globe with a team of ten people from Ecclesia Hollywood, a community of believers here in Los Angeles. Our goal is to forge long-term partnerships with some real heroes there.
 
In Mumbai (aka Bombay, aka Bollywood) we’ll work with a group called International Justice Mission whose mission is to rescue victims of violence, sexual exploitation, slavery and oppression. These people are no joke. They’re lawyers who go undercover into brothels, sweatshops, and other dangerous places to confront slavers and rescue victims. Ever met an 11-year old rape victim forced into prostitution? If there are real-life superheroes, it’s these people. www.ijm.org
 
Since many from our team work in Hollywood, we’ll also meet with counterparts in the Bollywood film industry. There are striking parallels between Los Angeles and Mumbai. Each city holds both the poorest and the richest of folks, often in marked tension. Recently, right here in nearby Orange County (yup, The O.C.), feds rescued dozens of Vietnamese women forced into sexual slavery. I suspect we have a lot to learn from each other.
 
Then our team will travel to Dehra Duhn, at the foot of the Himalayas. There we’ll visit SNEHA—a school, health clinic, and job training facility that serves slum dwellers. High unemployment has reduced a quarter million locals to scavenging recyclables for a living. These are folks who live in mud huts and share eight toilets for every 10,000 people. Yeah, it’s heavy. But SNEHA helps them break the povery cycle by educating and training them, and by offering health care. It’s totally Matthew 25:31-46 in action.
 
The last portion of our trip takes us up into Mussoorie, in the Himalayan mountains. There we’ll seek partnership opportunities with our friends Edwin and Nivedit who train pastors of small house churches and encourage rural groups of the poor and persecuted. As part of the 1% Christian minority in India, these folks face significant persecution.
 
I hate raising money. But I consider it an honor to raise money for this cause. I’ll be paying much of my own way, but the trip costs around $2,300, which is more than I can handle alone. Also, if I can raise extra dough it will go directly to our partner groups in India. As in, we will personally hand them money they need to rescue real actual people with faces, and names, and moms and dads.
 
It would be awesome if you could help out.
 
I’m not quite sure what I’m getting into here. So all prayers are welcome--for travel, health, cultural sensitivity, and hope all around. I’ll be gone October 19 – November 9. And if you can help out by donating some (tax-deductable) dough, afterwards I will be able to tell you which real people your money fed, or medicated, or rescued.
 
Checks or PayPal are welcome. My fundraising deadline is September 21.

Thank you in advance for your help. It means a ton to me. And even more to people who really need it.
 
Cheers,
Bob Massey

<b>  August 21, 2007 at 6:36:48 PM PDT

Watching "33" reminded me of the time I accidentally watched the second VHS tape of "Lawrence of Arabia" first.  I thought, "I know this is supposed to be a groundbreaking movie and everything...but this just doesn't make any damn sense."

For me, that record just kinda sucks except for "Sometimes You Can't Make It," which is tremendous in a similar way to "One."  He's so good when he's at his best.  That record sounds like the smooth jazz of rock 'n roll to me, somehow.  Canned.  Adult Contemporary.  Dull.  I tried to like it, but it didn't take.

<b> Aug 27, 2007, at 2:35 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> my relationship with u2 is kind of weird. basically i recognize all the maddening things about them, but certain stuff about them overcomes all that.

it seems like on every album there's at least one song that slays me, two more that become part of my internal fabric, and two that i skip every time. plus some other songs that exist at a sort of 'comfort food' level for me. i do think they possess the capacity to bust out and do some mind-blowing shit but they fear losing their title of Biggest Band In the World. like, if they decided not to think about it all so hard they could do The Unforgettable Fire 2.0. i wish they would just say fuck it and do something that really gets their blood up.

i tried to sequence Flesh and Spirits like a later u2 album. i think the effect on listeners was discernable, from what i've picked up.

i enjoy 'vertigo' viscerally but also think it's kinda crappy and obvious on another level.
'miracle drug' is a keeper for sure.
'sometimes you can't...' is the one that hit me the hardest. fuck me, that line "it's you when i don't pick up the phone" just kills me.
'love and peace or else' is every worst impulse they like to indulge.
from there i like the songs a good bit, although i think 'yahweh' is trying way too hard.

did you ever read 'u2 by u2'? it's a coffee table book. look it up on amazon. i have it and it's money well spent. i love it.</br></br>

I liked "ATYCLB" better than the Atomic Bomb record.  I even like that monkey/honey song, but mostly because there are very, very weird harmonies in it that are probably Daniel Lanois.

I asked if you had to think about it because your response was so clear and well-reasoned, that's all.

On another note:

Please write a comedy about a mentor/apprentice relationship, more-or-less like Mr. Miyagi and The Karate Kid, only make the mentor turn out to be a dead-wrong stooge.  It has to unfold slowly that he's an idiot, but slightly slower for the apprentice than for the audience.

<b> Aug 27, 2007, at 7:18 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i feel pretty similarly about this u2 record and the last. i didn't really have to think about my answer beforehand. why?

i definitely know what you mean about the smooth jazzness of it. but that's why i invoke the term "comfort food." which is mostly what it is. occasionally sublime, but most often just reassuring somehow.

on the last record there were more songs i had to ffwd through. whatever that fucking song is about "when we were monkeys swinging through the tree" and something about honey and shit... UGH. and "even better than the real thing" can suck me - or was that another record? can't remember.

i just stopped listening to them midway through "joshua tree." everyone loved that record but me. to me it's almost precisely the same record as the last two they made.

but that said, i recognize that they've been fixated on quote-unquote songwriting since then. making fucking shit for b.b. king to cover, or whatever. while it insures their place in history a la dylan (sorta), it is a Very Bad Idea.

however, i defy you not to love the "u2 by u2" book. most interesting thing about it: you can read between the lines and grasp that they made a conscious decision to grab the brass ring, and that they counted the cost at the time, and agreed to it. they made a plan, followed through, and it worked. and on a spiritual level, i must say, it seems to me bono has taken more seriously than just about anyone in history the idea that "from those whom much is given, much is expected" and "the last shall be first, the first shall be last." i very seriously think he's aware that he will likely be the last guy to march in behind the saints before the gates slam shut.

things to look for: there is exactly one (1) photo showing latter-day edge without a hat, bald head. and there is one (1) photo showing bono in civilian clothes (jeans, white t-shirt, adidas running shoes, in africa). i think these are the signifiers for the attentive reader that they have learned that the illusion is their bread and butter -- and the thing that allows them to do both art and good works. that they've made their bed and shouldn't complain about it.
oh also, there's a quote by bono along the lines of "one fat arse would end the band," meaning they all agreed to go to the gym and when someone gets tired of playing the part, the band will not work anymore.

it's not cynical either. it's really insightful and savvy and interesting.</br></br>

How are things?

I've been enjoying a sense of relief for the last couple of days that our trip to London to see Bob Dylan two years ago didn't work out.  Thursday night we went to Charlottesville to see him, and it was just unspeakably, amazingly horrible.  I've pasted a humorous, dead-on review below.  It wasn't a total wash, though; Elvis Costello opened, playing solo, and was just incredibly good.

When is your trip?

Dylan: A Special Night of Musical Genius, Fun and Frivolity
 
For those in attendance an JPJ arena, it was a night full of surprises.  From the first note, Bob kept both his band and the audience in a constant state of suspense.  Whether it was trying to figure out what song Bob was actually playing, when the song would end, or why Bob was wearing such a silly hat, the crowd seemed to be in a constant state of speechless wonderment. 
 
In an incredible display of musical genius, Bob was constantly playing in the key of A while his band was in E.  Always the wit, Bob would then switch to another key, once the band tried to match him.  Adding to the fun and intrigue, Bob altered the tone and tempo of each song so that the end result was an unrecognizable mass of cacophony.  There were laughs-o-plenty when the audience realized that Bob's piano was not even hooked up, and even more guffaws as Bob sang each song in a high-pitch staccato style reminiscent of a 250cc motocross bike stuck in a bog.
 
While Bob could have played all night, it was apparent that his band was exhausted and the magical night had to come to an end.  Bob is one of the greats, and Charlottesville will never forget this Cirque do Soleil extravaganza.</br></br>

<b> Sep 29, 2007, at 10:43 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> wow. what a weird experience that must have been. 

in college i went to see van morrison and it was so unlike the classic van morrison i was in love with that i kinda decided it was unwise to ever go see aging legends perform. there are probably exceptions i'd make, but i've skipped every reunion tour and all the big arena nostalgia-fests like van and dylan and all that. 

thing is, you really WANT dylan to just slay like every critic seems to think he still does. i dunno.

my trip = oct 19. i've raised a ton of dough for the team but i'm now concerned about paying my bills while i'm gone, so this thing is starting to get stressful.

actually, it's BEEN stressful. for weeks.

things otherwise: mostly shit.

i probably mentioned how i had a pretty brutal couple of weeks leading up to my birthday. bounced the first rent check ever, i think. pissed off my roommate who has to write the big rent check to the landlords. had to pick up odd jobs like catering and painting, plus a little charity money, just to pay the rent and bills. and i'm still behind. 

but all that was offset by the wonderfulness of emily, especially the birthday drive out into the country and all that. 

and then sunday she dumped me. i'm not really sure why. at first she told me this whole thing about how two guys back she felt convicted by god that she should not date anyone for a while, just sit tight. but she ignored that to go out with this guy craig, who i elbowed aside when i won her over. the irony, of course, being that i thought emily was the answer to my own prayers. so i kinda didn't believe that story, but you can't just say someone's lying or wrong about something like that, but i pried more and then she said something about how she didn't see a future for us. which i don't know what that means exactly. i'm forced to infer she just didn't think i was the right guy for her. except that i was so excited about the relationship and her and where it was going. and i really genuinely for the first time in my life felt like i could give a woman everything i had, i was willing to sacrifice, to go whatever distance was necessary. and i totally wouldn't mind. she's so great. and so of course this just ripped my heart out. so it's been a tough week. it hurts way out of proportion to the length of time we actually dated. but it was such an intense period of time, and i just love so much about her. so it's a struggle to not feel like my life is just shit. it's a deep hole. hard to see out. and of course all this comes right before i go to india - which i can't help but suspect maybe isn't a coincidence. i don't know where any of this is going. my life does not feel good, though.</br></br>

Maybe women do know, who knows?  Maybe there are things in her psychology that you can't fathom, or that she can't.  I don't know.  I'm just sorry.

Me, I'm fine.  Not much to report.  I guess I was kind of proud of myself on Friday.  Had been invited to play solo for a public radio fundraiser.  The scene was bullshit.  I eschewed the stage, played in the dead center of an art gallery sans PA.  People were absolutely forced to either listen or ignore--no halfway point.  Most did the latter, but the ones that listened became fans for life.  While waiting to go on (poorly organized, running late), Chesley and I decided to go have a mean drink at the Jefferson.  It's hot here still, and the AC felt good.  I told her what I was thinking I'd do back at the gallery, and she told me that Goethe said, "Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid."

We also ran into Collee, who looks great and is doing well.</br></br>

saw emily at church today. shared a little hug, a little chitchat. didn't want to blow my brains out. i have no more understanding than i did, though more than one person who heard about the situation volunteered that she's a notorious flake - seems to be a defining character trait.

i've thought a lot about how the way i feel must be some echo of the way jesus feels all the time when people he loves don't want him. not to actually compare, etc etc. but i mean, that kinda helps me extend some grace and sympathy to someone i care passionately about who has possibly made an enormous mistake from lack of vision. or maybe she didn't, who knows? maybe we wouldn't work out together. i don't know, but maybe women just know.

Indeed, I'll be 35 on Tuesday the 23rd.  Whoop-dee-doo.

Jason sent me some songs of his new band.  I made comparisons to Steve Vai and Steve Howe, and I haven't heard anything back from him.  I meant both in a good way!

Chesley's having a rough time.  That's hard.

I interviewed for a management job with a super high-end kitchen cabinet shop in town.  If I got it I'd have a) a lot more stress in my life and b) a lot more money.  Eventually I want to open my own small shop, but we're never going to have the money at this rate.

Not much else going on.

You leave on Friday.  Cool.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Bob,

I was fascinated by your blog.  What a trip.  

Things here are good.  

Are you affected by the writers' strike?

The movie idea "THE MAN OF MY DREAMS" is this:

Movie opens with two people on a successful, enjoyable date.  Everything goes right.  They're clearly falling in love.

Cut to a woman's closed eyes, close up.  The eyes open.  IT WAS ALL JUST A DREAM.

She goes to work or somewhere, where she tells her friends that it happened again.  They kid around..."He put the SEAT DOWN? You must be dreaming!"  And all that kinda crap.

Anyhow, this pattern repeats a couple of times.  New date in each dream.  Memorable images from the dates, important later.

OKAY.

Now another dream happens.  Same deal, close up of closed eyes.  But when they open, IT'S THE GUY!!!  He's dreaming about her.  They're having THE SAME DREAMS AT THE SAME TIME!  He tells his buddies...they think he's kinda faggy...yadda yadda.

And the rest is totally obvious.  Cue the memorable images, etc.

</b> <br><br> Interesting what you say about Casey Affleck.  I thought he stole the show in the first Ocean's movie.  There's something special about that guy.  As for his brother...go figure.  How weird it must be to be Ben Affleck.  Win an Oscar right out of the gate and then decline rapidly before your 35th birthday.  The "Retainer" scene in Good Will Hunting is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

How was No Country?  I really doubt that Chesley and I could handle it, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.

Work stuff is going well in that I've got a shop space and am taking on side work.  I hope to be able to make a full-time go of it in the next year.  I got an incredible deal--no lease, lots of space, most machinery already in place.  All of this for $500.  My day job blows.  Most days I just stand around for 9.5 hours.  I expect layoffs after the holidays.

Band stuff simply is not going at all.  I don't touch the guitar or the piano.  No idea what my deal is.  I'm just completely uninterested.  Why?

<b> Nov 21, 2007, at 4:52 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i went to see AMC the other night down the street from my house. it wasn't that great but i enjoyed it a lot. it was kind of exactly the right thing for the moment. they were pretty sloppy, eitzel was scattered, and they had no keyboardist. but even on a bad day they're better than most.

how's the work stuff going?
how's the band stuff going?

i'm in a pretty weird headspace here but coming through it okayish.

this week's random pondering: is the shuffle feature on my laptop's itunes smarter than the shuffle on my ipod? i think it is.

i saw two movies yesterday: LARS AND THE REAL GIRL and GONE BABY GONE. both really good. i laffed my ass off at LARS. and casey affleck is amazing both in GONE and THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES. and his brother can direct, who knew?</br></br>

<b> Nov 21, 2007, at 5:19 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is pretty amazing but it's brutal. dunno if you read the book but it's pretty faithful. a writer guy here said something interesting about it which is that he was fascinated with its depiction of evil as the inability to imagine another person's point of view. aka absolute certainty that one is right. heavy.

I just don't think Chesley and I could stand it.  I'm sure it's well done.  Ever since the Harveys were murdered, it's like neither of us can take even the most mundane TV violence.  I've not read the novel, and probably won't.  I'm more interested in THE ROAD, which my sister said she couldn't put down despite it being the darkest thing she'd ever taken in.


i would be shocked if ben affleck didn't get a best picture and best director nomination. and casey will probably get a best supporting nomination for JESSE JAMES. could be the second act in ben affleck's career. i love, by the way, that f. scott fitzgerald was wrong about that.

How is that JESSE JAMES movie?  I wanted to see that, but I don't think it was here for more than a few days.  Tonight we're watching KNOCKED UP which ought to be just about right after several days of family whatnot and a really bad cold on my part.

how did you get this amazing deal? are you renting space from harrison?


There's this guy Clay who faithfully reads my blog and periodically comments on the posts.  Turns out he and I went to the same high school at the same time.  We've gotten to be friends, which has led to some side work for me.  The space is owned by a friend of a friend of his.  It's a great situation.  It's kind of heavenly to be in there doing my own thing.  This weekend would have been my first chance to really bear down on the space (I have lots of organizing to do), but this damn cold got in the way.

as for band stuff, i have those periods. i'm coming out of one now, i think. i think there's ambient pressure to be prolific but i find that i do best if i have fallow periods.

I hope you're right.  


weird headspace is kind of a second chapter to the pre-india disintegration of everything i was hoping for. girl, writing, hopes for the cd, inability to pay rent, etc.  i decided it was probably a good way to approach india, just wiped out and blank. which it was. my goal was to leave myself behind and serve the people we met there. i think that worked. but now i'm back and trying to maintain that attitude. it's hard. especially here in the capital of narcissism where one's product is oneself. and it's taking a surprisingly long time to get past emily. there's the loneliness and then there's the deeply weird feeling of having one's gestures of grace rejected because of the scars from one's past. not quite sure how to feel about that. anyway, i'm moving through it. emailed emily yesterday to propose a friendly coffee to catch up, with the idea of reestablishing things on a friendly plateau. no response. which i know is intentional because she gets all her email immediately on her iphone. whatever, though. my motives are clear on this. she'll get around to a response.

Have you heard anything?  I hope so.  I'm sorry this is tough. 


sort of related: my friend alison from seattle re-established contact 11 months after cutting me off because she wanted to get over me, or whatever. i think i shared that with you back when. anyway, i hate feeling like the bad guy for something i didn't do and don't understand, so it's kind of a relief to get email from her.

I'm glad.  That is a relief, even much later.  I remember hearing about this, though a quick search of my email does not turn anything up for "Allison."


i am a much better human being when there's a woman in my life, and this is sort of a primary concern right now.

Dude, I totally hear you, and I totally empathize.  For what it's worth, and by way of encouragement, neither Chesley nor I planned on ever being with anyone again.  We'd both completely had it with the whole thing.  You're one of my favorite human beings, and I have complete faith that you will find your match.</br></br>

Ca va bien.

It's good to hear from you.

I've started my own shop and am pretty busy with that.  The business isn't self-sufficient yet, but I've got a good head start.  I've been totally preoccupied with it since the beginning of November.  Tomorrow I'm delivering a piece to the Virginia Historical Society--a stand for a sculpture of Merriwether Lewis walking his dog.  Am hoping for more museum work of this kind.  It's challenging and reasonably lucrative.

Chesley is doing well.  She's started working at a branch of the Henrico County Public Library, which she likes a lot.  We're reading Anna Karenina together this winter.  Actually, she knits and I read aloud.  I get to be kind of a ham, and she gets an audio book.  We've been doing this since we got married.  So far we've read some Vonnegut (Have you ever read him?  He should be taken more seriously, damn it!), some David Foster Wallace, some Graham Greene.  It makes for a rewarding evening of entertainment.  I've been trying to find a comprehensible book about neuroscience and think I may have come across one --In Search of Memory by Eric Kandel.  Pretty fascinating so far (I'm on, like, page 4.)

Et vous?  What's been going on?  How are things?  What's on your mind?

Chesley's working until 9 tonight, so I'll just be sitting here watching Antiques Roadshow (yes, I'm a nerd--big news, right?), so if you feel like a protracted email back-and-forth, I'm game!

Best,

Tim

</b> <br><br> I want to hear those demos please.  Is the drummer away on that big Police tour?  Because I heard that guy really sucks!  I made a mix for Harrison a while ago which had GRB's "Mercy" as the last song.  That was a good mix.  Playlist attached.  Harrison, who generally likes Tom Waits, said of track 6, "What was that thing that sounded like Elvis Presley on LSD?"

Me.  Nothing at all since October which has been extremely invigorating.  I haven't thought about or listened to any of my own songs for a few months.  Jason and I are talking about working on some recording soon, which would be fun.   I think I can officially say that I don't want or expect anything from it other than some fun with friends at this point, and that's a relief.

Hey, do you listen to Sound Opinions?  Man, do I love that show.  Last week they focussed on Rock's "Unsung Heroes" and solicited listener's same.  I called three times, which is kind of embarrassing.  One of my nominees was Pen, who I really do think is a visionary.  You'll never guess the others!</br></br>

<b> Jan 24, 2008, at 8:51 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i need the right slogan.

I think Pen may already have the slogan: FUCK FALSE METAL!

I'm sure I don't appreciate the nuances of that statement, but it does seem kinda catchy.

Sound Opinions is these two music critics in Chicago who do an hour-long talk show through WBEZ.  You can subscribe to the Podcast on iTunes.  It's very, very pleasurable.  Sometimes they have guests and ask amazing questions.  They're like the ultimate rock snob nerds and proud of it.  I've learned a lot from listening to the back-episodes over the past month.

I look forward to your reactions to Fox Confessor.  That's one of the two most played records in our household, with the other being The Lyre of Orpheus.  It's been that way for over a year.  Speaking of which, yeah, we watched that video for Dig Lazurus.  Did you read his quote about how creeped out the Lazarus story made him feel when he was a kid?

I enjoyed Control Z.  Tony Hale is great.  My favorite line from all of Arrested Development is one of his, when he's talking about the bird that got into the apartment.  He says...this KILLS ME...he says, "But he walked on my pillow."  

A close second is "Look at me...getting off...on being withholding."

Of course there's always "Everybody's cornholing except Buster."

Did you hear anything from the folks you met with re. Thursday?</br></br>

<b> Jan 24, 2008, at 9:08 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> oh, duh. fuck false metal, of course.

i did read that cave quote about lazarus. i had to wonder if he'd ever heard that AMC song, "i've been a mess." 

I wondered the same thing.  It doesn't seem like something that everyone involved could have missed, but who knows?


it gives me no end of pleasure on the days tony serves communion at church to watch people do double-takes. more than most character actors would, i think being served communion by "buster" freaks them out. hi - larious.

Dude, that is far out.  I didn't know you knew Buster.  Wait til I tell Chesley!


we're still busting ass to put the finishing touches on the long treatment for those people. then i send it to kinkos, then i take it to them. couple days. not sure how long til we get a response.

Keep me posted.  And email me some damn demos!</br></br>

<b> Jan 24, 2008, at 9:22 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> i will. but the demos are nowhere near listenable yet.

</b> <br><br> Jason and Katey came down here for dinner last Friday, and Chesley and I were trying to tell them how great Nick Cave was.  They had both more-or-less written him off as too "theater class," which I totally understand.  I used to feel the same way.  My point of view used to be, "Yeah...I read Faulkner in high school, too."  But he's grown so far beyond all that.  And these videos seem to hilariously lampoon his former self.  Awesome!</br></br>

<b> Feb 24, 2008, at 3:10 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Yesterday I was listening to the independent radio station's new
music program while I worked.  One craptacular song after another
came on.  I was feeling so cynical.  Every generation has to
rediscover what it sounds like when you change a major chord to a
minor chord with the same root, everyone has to re-do the Beatles,
or Minor Threat, or whatever.  Why can't they just do it in
private, I wondered.

Then a song with the refrain "Remember Who You Are" came on.
Straightforward pop tune, nice production, really nice keyboards.
But nothing showy.  Just solid songcraft.  I was moved.  Then I
started thinking, this guy sounds like Mark Eitzel if Mark Eitzel's
range was centered around a note about a fifth higher than it is.
After a while I realized it really couldn't be anybody but AMC.
Fantastic.  Did the guy take some voice lessons?  I mean, I like
his voice anyway, but it's at a different level on this.  Your
thoughts?

You watching anything on TV tonight?

<b> Feb 24, 2008, at 3:25 PM / Tim McCready / </b> <br><br> It's weird how his singing has changed.  I mean, it's still him,
but slightly more focussed or something.  It's a slight technical
improvement.  We're sitting here listening, and we both think it's
kind of adult contemporary--I in a good way, Chesley in a boring
way.  I don't know.  It's quiet and kind of pretty.

As for superbowl sunday, that's why I asked--do you have any
plans?  We're going to watch.  I don't think my friend Josie has a

i can't swear that i've met katey. what's she like?

that's funny / sad / funny that you finally got to hang with jason whilst stable. it's not always a given that jason's stable.

dude, how's the f/t You biz?

i liked MICHAEL CLAYTON. didn't change my life but very solid. and tilda swinton was indeed a badass in it. though the supporting actress category was a tossup for me. i think i picked someone else.

re nick cave in berlin: mike and i were gonna meet labradford at the venue since they were playing the event, which was a mute records 20th anniversary party, i think. but they didn't show. so we didn't have tix, and our other friends were already inside. so i was like: hey, let's go around back and see if any doors are open. so we did, and some guy walked out, and mike grabbed the door and we slipped in. way down in the bowels of the concert hall. we walked around for a long time, found the dressing rooms, took some beverages from nick cave's deserted dressing room. we were looking for the main theater but couldn't find it. finally we heard some piano music playing behind a door, which seemed weird. we thought maybe it was a rehearsal room. so we cracked the door -- all black inside. when we stepped inside, we found ourselves in the wings of the stage, behind the lights, and at the balcony level. so we were looking down on nick cave playing by himself. it was those songs from "no more shall we part," which are gorgeous, but at the time had not yet been released. so we're like: SCORE! eventually the bad seeds came out and joined him. it was awesome.

later we snuck back down to the bar in the basement of the theater and hung out. i got to talk to f.m. einheit from einsturzende neubauten, which was super cool. he's the guy who banged on mic'd shopping carts and set shit on fire. total badass. they're an incredibly musical ensemble for guys who play hardware.</br></br>

I've done #1 to some extent.  I bought it and listened once.  I will listen loudly and repeatedly soon, I promise.

As for #2...

I'd say that women who are chronically messy and unable to get their careers together in any meaningful way can be worth the trouble--I married one and am glad I did.  This despite the fact that I'm a little bit of a neatnick myself, having recovered (mostly) from slobbery.  Same with the showering--not particularly helpful, diagnostically.

The part about repeating stories and associated context info is a bit more concerning.  Does she smoke pot?  I think pot smoking can cause that.  Still, not all that concerning.

The most concerning thing to my ear is this: "...even though neither of you have the money or energy to fly back and forth, and at least one of you does  not have that level of desire..."  There's the telling diagnostic.  The condition is a serious one, and it's called "unrequited love."

Reminds me of when my friend Fr. Michael, after I'd explained all the stuff that worried me about Mary M., basically said, "Okay.  So what?  Do you love her?"  I hemmed and hawed, but of course I didn't, really.

You know, my relationship with Chesley has some very serious problems which I expect will last as long as we're together, and I suspect we'll be together until one or the other of us dies.  The thing is, there's just no question about whether or not it's worth the trouble.  It just is, and has been.  It requires no explanation.  The explanation, when things are difficult is plainly, "This is totally worth it...I love her...far out."  I had heard about this kind of thing, but didn't really believe it.

And so weiter.  I've had three beers.  If any of this is annoyingly didactic, I beg your patience and forgiveness.

<b> Mar 27, 2008, at 12:41 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> The sextet Eighth Blackbird (http://www.eighthblackbird.com/) premiered a new piece, Double Sextet, last night at U of R.  They're in residence there and are super cool people.  Reich was there for the premiere; I met him coming out of the can--he was kind of irritated until I got to my point, which was basically "Thank you so much."  Then he was a big softy, and gracious.

The performance was completely amazing.

Afterwards they had a Q & A.  Maybe 35 people stuck around.  I asked him about his harmonic sensibility.  THEN one of the guys from the group mentioned that there would be another Q & A session specifically with Reich today from 11:15-12:30.  So of course I went to that.  He played the recording of a new work with text from the Book of Daniel and from Daniel Perl's last words.  It was spectacular, about 30 minutes long.  Then he took questions.  Maybe 20 people there, tops, mostly young college kids.  I asked him how he's dealt with artistic impasses and failures.  He talked about an exhibit at the Whitney that Edward Hopper's estate put on of Hopper's B- and C- grade paintings.  Reich is a big Hopper fan, but found the paintings depressingly bad.  He went home and erased a bunch of tapes.  He also said he only uses "save as" on his Mac so that he has a record of most of what he's done since the 80's.  He said that all that stuff is starting to get archived.

NOW, on another note, I got talking to one of the Eighth Blackbird dudes--the violinist--and I asked him if he'd been aware of the Nitrate Hymnal.  It seemed like he may have heard about it, but he wasn't sure.  I told him that I really thought he might like your stuff.  He asked me to email him through their site and that he'd definitely get the message if I did.  So maybe you should email him some press clippings?  I'll do it if you want, but maybe it'd be better if it came straight from you.  If you do email him, could you copy me on it?  They won a grammy this year.

Ah yes, then the picture.  Boy did I feel like a dork!  Reich was like, "Okay, okay...no extra charge!"  I told him that a friend of mine often says, while onstage, "You know, a request is really more of a suggestion unless it's accompanied by a hundred-dollar bill."  He liked that, which is why I think he's smiling.  Dorky, but I mean, it was totally worth it!<BusinessCard1.jpg></br></br>

<b> Mar 27, 2008, at 12:53 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Hi Matt,

Thanks again for such a fantastic performance last night.  I'm pretty confident that hearing Eighth Blackbird debut a Steve Reich piece will remain one of the highlights of my musical life for a long, long time.

I mentioned our conversation to my friend Bob Massey, who lives in L.A. now.  In 2003, The Washington Performing Arts Society presented his opera, The Nitrate Hymnal.  It was well-attended and well-reviewed.  Bob has a very singular sensibility.  In any case, I left it to him to contact you through your site if he wants to.

I sure hope I wasn't incoherent earlier--Steve Reich's music has had a very long and very positive influence in my life, and meeting him was a tad surreal.  I was kind of on a goofy high, like I was in seventh grade or something!

Once again, thanks for your performance last night.

Best,

Tim

<b> Mar 27, 2008, at 4:53 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hey there Matt and Tim -

Well, it's nice to have friends willing to stump for me.

I've been into Eighth Blackbird for some time now, so it's also nice to be introduced, virtually. I hope this finds you well.

The project Tim mentioned to you - The Nitrate Hymnal - is a multimedia opera based on home movies my grandparents shot in the 1940s-80s. Musically, it combines aspects of the NY New Music scene and the DC post-punk scene. Both the live show and the CD are peopled by players from Bang On A Can, Alarm Will Sound, Anti-Social Music, Gutbucket, The Hold Steady, Fugazi, and a bunch of others.

We received backing from a bunch of places: Creative Capital, Meet the Composer, the Bang On A Can summer institute, Washington Performing Arts Society, and so on.

The album is available on iTunes, though I'd be happy to send you one if you like.
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=193238666&s=143441

Also, I've attached a clipping from The Washington Post which explains a lot about the live event.

I hope you're enjoying your stay in Richmond. That's my hometown and there's lots I miss about it. Tim's a pretty good resource to find out what's happening, as well. Tim, is Mama Zu still around? Man, that was some kickass Italian food...

Cheers,
Bob Massey

<b> Mar 27, 2008, at 4:54 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> DUDE. That is so kickass. That is some hot Reich action. Nice work.

Did I tell you I saw a real life Edward Hopper on someone's mantel here? Long story, but I was at Roland Emmerich's house (makes movies where shit blows up) and I kept eyeing this painting propped above his fireplace. Couldn't see a name in the corner, and I didn't recognize the actual scene, but I was pretty sure it was a Hopper so I asked. And it was. No people in it, just a toy train rolling through an empty living room blowing black smoke. I considered actually touching it but didn't.

Explain the "save as" thing. I know what that does but why is that significant?

I know of Eighth Blackbird. They're peers of Bang On A Can and Anti-Social Music and Alarm Will Sound - all of whom worked on The Nitrate Hymnal in some way.

I'm so stoked - and a tiny bit jealous - that you got to hang out with Steve Reich. I can't wait to hear his new stuff.

Also, thanks for the plug to the 8th Blackbird guy.</br></br>

I have an idea for the mother of all coffee table books.  It'd be a collection of all the stills included in AD.  If you think it through, they're some of the funniest things about the show.

Things are pretty good here.  It seems like I'm actually going to be able to make a living with my own business.  Not much of one, but at least as well as I was doing working for the man, and hopefully better before too long.  Am moving to a much better, more centrally located shop on May 1.

Not much else news.

I've been thinking about you, meaning to write.

I have a new shop space, in Scott's Addition, and through a pleasant twist of fate it is now equipped with a $3,000 stereo system (Don't worry--I paid less than $100).  Last night I was working late listening to "Flesh and Spirits" real loud, making a model of a dining room table I'm starting on.  I really like that record.  I think my favorite song is The Joke I Play on Washington, but it's hard to say.  So anyhow, I was thinking of you.

I have a lease, a building with a sign, and a bunch of other trappings of legit business...except not much work to speak of.  Happily I think that's changing, but it's been a scary couple of weeks.

I just watched a fascinating NOVA about Issac Newton.  What a weird dude.  He predicted that the big ruckus of Armegeddon would happen in 2060.

Phone conversation until 3:30.  Wow.  So how's it going with Amy?  What's the word?

What  *is*  the role of personal faith in certain modern romantic relationships?

My theology sure is changing.  Not sure if it's getting more ortho- or -heterodox.  I'm serious.  Basically it's about trusting God to love me even though I really am pretty lame in so many crucially important ways.  Almost zero piety.  Little attempt to be good. Lust-ravaged.  Not prayerful.  Not meditative.  Not centered, or even trying very hard.  I make the sign of the cross on myself every morning.  Sometimes I think it's like all the portrayals of Italian gangster Catholics in the movies, where they're out murdering and stealing all week, then earnestly genuflecting before they sit their asses down in a pew on Sunday morning.  Here are the tenets of this evolving theology:

1) Got is omnipotent, and that's no joke.  
2) He loves you, but not in the way you think of love most of the time.
3) You're kind of a cretin despite you're best efforts (which are--to be realistic--mostly wasted energy)
4) Despite #3, there is NOTHING you can do to stop #2
5) All the emphasis on having a "personal relationship" with the almighty is understandable, but misguided. 

There's more, but Chesley just got home from work.

Have you seen the TV show "Peep Show?"  It's as funny as AD.  Collee recommended it to us.  Amazing.

</br></br>

<b> Jun 10, 2008, at 8:38 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hello Timothy.

I am sitting here procrastinating by reading "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson, which is way more kickass and enjoyable than I expected. Fiction involving codebreaking in WW2 and its applications in modern technology biz.

Funny, Cat Power came up last night with Amy -- before we sat in the car and had the big end-of-night discussion / argument about the role of personal faith in certain modern romantic relationships. And ensuing phone discussion til 3:30am. And today's text that she's getting out of town for a few days.

So yeah, anyway, I blame Cat Power.

Chan "Cat Power" Marshall has a long and well-documented history of affecting debilitating stage shyness. It's a typical indie rock bullshit move. "Oh, I'm too shy and scatterbrained to complete this song or to look at the audience even though I've played a hundred shows a year for the last fifteen years, how dainty and emotionally delicate I must be, don't you feel sympathy and want to purchase a t-shirt?"

That said she has an interesting voice and I understand her newer records are less cloying. Whatever, though. I've seen her a couple times and been supremely annoyed.

Yes, we can still be friends. I'll probably end up marrying her, given the perverse way my life is going.

Q: is my soul mortally endangered since I purchased that new Coldplay song?

I am exhausted today. I think it is hilarious that you're deeply worried about going to heaven.

Sometimes I am too but not in that way.

Best thing all week: lines from Flight of the Conchords rap song, "I'm the hip-hop-o-potamus, my rhymes are bottomless... [breath, he then stares into the camera at a loss for words]."</br></br>

<b> Jun 11, 2008, at 10:32 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> You must watch the first season of Peep Show before the day's up.
I promise you'll be so glad you did.

I will look for Buechner.  I think Harrison mentioned him to me a
decade ago.  I could use something like that right now.

I'm sorry to hear about Amy.  I completely understand about
wishing there was a way the faith divide wouldn't matter, but if
it matters, it matters.  It's possible that some day you'll end up
with like a wiccan babe or something, but you won't have any
control over whether it's okay with you or not.  There's my $.02.

The new Cat Power single just came on.  It's kind of like The
Rolling Stones if they'd recorded for Stax, with very smoky vocals
buried in the mix.  I googled her after what you said, and I see
that many people concur with your assessment.  The thing is, she's
pretty hot, so I don't really see what difference her personality
makes.

Please get some of your movie friends to order some damn furniture

<b> Jun 11, 2008, at 12:21 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> The only way that price difference could make sense would be if they
just sell a ton more of the larger ones.  If they have to do
anything different, like flip a few switches, to make the shorter
ones, that's why they'd charge more.  Other than that, no idea.

That Coldplay song is on the radio right now.  It's pretty okay.  Kinda like U2 meets Crime & The City Solution.  Or, like, something.

Before that was a new Portishead tune that was really good.  Also a new Death Cab song which totally blew.  The first single from their new album was interesting.  Not sure it was successful.  Kind of had 4 or 5 very cool elements, but somehow failed to take off.  I dunno.  I thought it was kind of making vague references to Talk Talk.</br></br>

I'm sorry to hear about Amy.  I completely understand about wishing there was a way the faith divide wouldn't matter, but if it matters, it matters.  It's possible that some day you'll end up with like a wiccan babe or something, but you won't have any control over whether it's okay with you or not.  There's my $.02.

The new Cat Power single just came on.  It's kind of like The Rolling Stones if they'd recorded for Stax, with very smoky vocals buried in the mix.  I googled her after what you said, and I see that many people concur with your assessment.  The thing is, she's pretty hot, so I don't really see what difference her personality makes.

<b> Jun 11, 2008, at 2:09 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Okay, here's a stupid question. I was looking to buy a bed and I
got interested in these Japanese platform beds. (Like this one,
minus the headboard: http://www.foamorder.com/view_image.php?sunset_low)
. That one in the picture is the "low" model, meaning 9" high. It
costs $100 *more* than the 12" high model. Why does less bed cost
more?

An academic question, perhaps, since I can't blow $600 on a bed at
this point in my life. But now I want to know.

Wiccan babes'll screw you silly, so I'm down with that situation.
God can just lump it.

You know, I'm sitting here racking my brain to think how to connect
you with the art department world in Hollywood but I kinda have no
idea.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> This is such a lovely tribute to such an unlikely thing.  It's really a poem, I think.  See my edits below.  My favorite line is probably, "obviously, it is soft and padded."

Phone photos to computer = Bluetooth.  I went through the same thing.  It's super easy once you find the right sequence of buttons.

Someone in L.A. spent a really long time at my blog yesterday or today.  Was it you?

"Ugly as balls" reminds me--has that "Peep Show" DVD arrived yet?

Did I ever get you a copy of that letter from Walker Percy to Shelby Foote where he says, "What am I waiting for?  The muse?  No.  Fuck her!"  It's very funny.

Today I submitted application materials for an associate editor position at "Fine Woodworking."

I'm still preoccupied with eternity, uncomfortably so.

Did you know Joe Bauserman when you were here?  Did your paths ever cross?  He has very awful brain and lung cancer.  He was my first good therapist and is largely responsible to my surviving my 20s.  The doctors think there is more hope than it sounds like there would be, and I hope they're right.



for some reason i was sitting in my 
WONDROUS 1974 GOLD VELOUR HICKORY HOUSE MFG SWIVELING EASY CHAIR 
that is ugly as balls but which i will  
never sell 
no matter how much any hypothetical woman pleads, and i thought of 
you.

i looked for a photo on the web that i could share with you 
but there are none i can find. 
i know you love furniture though 
so i may be  forced to figure out how to get 
photos from my phone 
to my computer.

granted this is not the kind of furniture you build, 
because it is ugly, 
but perhaps it pays to know your enemy because this chair IS 
THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIR IN THE KNOWN WORLD. 
i refer to it as "the chair  of slumber." 
perhaps you spotted it in my room or house sometime in 
the past. 

it is a marvel. 
it swivels and rocks. 
it is perfectly  
proportioned to allow one's head to loll back. 
also you can sit  sideways in it and drape your legs over the armrest yet still be comfy. 
obviously, it is soft and padded. 
did i mention the brown  piping? 
oh lord yes it is ugly, yes. 

but in my fantasy it is situated on the bridge of the starship yesteryear 
and i am the narcoleptic captain! 
it accompanies me to my destiny. 
the arm rest covers slip off  but no matter.

How so?

Because I bear a similar relationship to M. MacInnis as the USS
Arizona does to the Adm. Yamamoto of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Okay okay, there's probably a better metaphor out there somewhere.
But
I was so utterly unsuspecting and guileless and smitten. But every
woman since (and many male friends) have seen the jagged puncture
scars and asked about them. They throb whenever my pulse goes up  
in a
woman's presence. Probably all my major life decisions since are
half-
informed by echoes of terrible things she said. And I know she knew
she was mean to me, but I also know she didn't mean to be such a
tectonic force in my history. So what are you gonna do?

Japan is our friend now, but still, you can visit the Arizona
memorial
and watch the oil bubble up to the surface.

http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3DD1F3CF931A2575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all

NYT: The character Jack in ''The Designated Mourner'' becomes
completely bored with his own sense of self. Does that happen to  
you?

WS: I think there's something idiotic about the self, that every  
day
you have to get up and be the same person. And when your work  
centers
around yourself, as work in the so-called arts does, there can be
something so idiotic about it that it is boring. It can be somewhat
infuriating to wake up and find that one has the same  
characteristics
that one had when one went to bed the night before.

NYT: I'm sorry. I just laughed. Was that supposed to be funny or  
not?

WS: I honestly don't know.

I think I exaggerated how little changes.  I read more of those emails, and I think I have shed more of my adolescence than I had at 23-25, thanks be to God.    

It's funny about being surprised that you could write back then, too.  You were you, even then.  That is something I have been puzzled by so much these last few months: The continuity of consciousness.  Think of what has to go right in the brain for each of us to wake up the same person every morning.  Memory is still almost a complete mystery, and yet it works, or at least it works up to a point.

I suppose we should be less surprised by the similarities we bear to our former selves and more surprised by the subtle changes, the development, the broadening, hopefully the growing capacity for compassion and love.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's epilepsy.  Thing is, you might have it, too. 

Check this out:

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Neurotheology and Paranormal Experience

The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with TLE was neurologist Norman Geschwind, who noted a constellation of symptoms, including hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, fainting spells, mutism and pedantism, often collectively ascribed to a condition known as Geschwind syndrome.

Vilayanur S. Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using galvanic skin response, which correlates with emotional arousal, to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall enhanced emotional response, or if the enhancement was specific to religious stimuli (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). By presenting subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR, Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe is specifically involved in generating some of the emotional reactions associated with religious words, images and symbols.

We're going to D.C. tomorrow to see the Martin Puryear show at the NGA.  Also, the Folk Life Festival is happening which normally wouldn't be our thing, but Bhutan is the featured culture, and Chesley has a longstanding interest in their textiles.  Did you know that Bhutan has been measured as the "happiest" country?  Also, one of their most prevalent national symbols--one often seen in graffiti and in more refined forms of artistic expression--is an ejaculating penis?  I'm not making this up, we read about it in The Atlantic.

</b> <br><br> DC was mixed.  The Martin Puryear exhibit ranks up there with the best museum art shows I've ever seen.  The Folk Life Festival was bizarre.  We walked over there to see the master weavers and whatnot, and the entire thing was completely deserted.  There were all these empty tents, empty booths, and so on.  Kind of freaky.  I later heard a stagehand's radio saying that it was time to call everyone back as the thunderclouds had passed.

</b> <br><br> Once I saw an installation at the Guggenheim by this guy Felix Gonzales-Torres which was essentially several piles of candy dumped here and there.  Seemed like one thing for it to be in a museum, but I learned later that people paid big bucks for similar piles of candy for their own private spaces.

Which seems absurd whether saying so makes me a philistine or not.

Chesley thinks that the recreations of Giotto's work at Assisi are a fool's errand for a similar reason.  His hand has been obliterated--there is nothing to preserve.  It's gone, deal with it, you know?

Were Jesus to pay us a visit in the form of an arsonist I think museums would be well below fundamentalist megachurches preaching the "prosperity gospel" on his list of stuff to torch.

</b> <br><br> She is a full-blooded monkey dog, and I'll send pictures tomorrow since they're all on the computer at the shop.  She is black, grey, pink, and brown in descending order of prevalence.  She grew up on the meanstreets surrounding Jeff Davis highway and has several pieces of bird shot embedded in her cute self.  Shooting a dog like this is undoubtedly the sin against the Holy Spirit.

We love this animal so much it's just nuts.  Chesley got her a couple of years before she and I reconnected.

Names we call her include:

Little monkey dog

Booger Bean

Black bean burrito monkey

Sugar plum fairy dog

Lil' Haiku

KuKu

Kukadooks

Chaweeka lamb

Boogers McDog

Lambykin McBoogers

Chaweeka McDogersen

Snuggletron

Snuggletron 3000

Snuggletron 3000 Deluxe Alarm Clock Edition

Lil' Dog

and God knows what else.

The thing is, she's so smart that she'll answer to any of these.

She's a very dainty eater for a dog, very polite.  

Her favorite treats include pretzel bites, cashews, and been tendons.

She STANDS ON HER FRONT LEGS to pee.  We suspect that she does this to get her scent higher up the pole, but who knows?

She hates at least 90% of all other dogs.

She tolerates cats most of the time, but sometimes assumes the roll of "kitty police" when things get out of hand around here.

She is flawless in all ways but one.  One flaw ain't so bad.

<b>  July 7, 2008 at 1:08:27 PM PDT
 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  I'm Perplexed
</b> <br><br> Bob,

I am so perplexed by some of the norms of evangelical christian prayer I've been encountering lately.  I trust that God receives all prayer offered in faith--or even the wish for faith--and by naming my qualms I don't mean to insult others' piety, although I think it will inevitably sound like that.  I just don't understand where certain types of prayers are coming from theologically.  

[I've tried to write this second paragraph several times now, and each time it comes across wrong.  Maybe this is more of an in-person conversation, I don't know.  I'll keep trying.]

Sometimes I hear prayers and feel like they're weirdly obsequious--and yet quite demanding--instructions to a spoiled despot.  Have I become an apostate if I believe that my petitions won't change God's mind?  What kind of omniscience would God's be if my prayer brought something to His attention that He didn't already know?  If someone I love very much is going to die momentarily, and I pray that the person live instead, what would it suggest about God if He changed His mind based on my request?  Doesn't that seem quite capricious?  Doesn't it seem like putting Him to the test?

Somehow that C.S. Lewis line "Prayer doesn't change things; it changes me" seems lost.  Where is the take-off-your-sandals-in-My-presence awe when one speaks to God the way a poor manager speaks to an employee whom he wants to do some task?  I'm talking about demands disguised as a kind of weak groveling.  Surely we are made in His image, but do we sometimes think He's made in ours?  Does this mode of prayer begin to imply that we are the gods around here--not Him?  And isn't that a dangerous type of blasphemy--not for God, who can handle it, but for those committing it, who probably can't?

But again, I trust that God hears all prayers, even the problematic ones.  I'm grateful for that since all of mine are problematic.  

It's just that certain expressions of the faith are beginning to ring hollow--to sound like the opposite of faith, oddly--to my ear.  I know I should not judge.

I remember in the very earliest days of my conversion that you suggested this "formula" for prayer: ACTS, which I think was Acclamation, Contrition, Thanksgiving, and Supplication. That still seems about right to me.  When I try to follow that outline these days, though, I find that words fail.  I also find that I'm actually praying the prayer of my heart more directly once the words have not only failed, but mostly ceased.

Where does all this ordering Him around come from?  How widespread is it?  What's the difference between recognizing God as Father versus thinking of Him as a hapless sitcom dad?

Joe Bauserman is doing incredibly well.

I am pretty beat.  Delivered a piece of furniture to Philadelphia yesterday, got back this afternoon.  More work lined up, which is good.

Interviewed for associate editor position at Fine Woodworking.  Went great, I'd take the job, but they weren't flexible about relocation, and that's not in the cards for us right now.  I really liked the managing editor, and I hope there's a way I can participate in their furtherance of the craft and whatnot without having to uproot our lives.

Long car trips make me feel kind of nutty and displaced.  I'm taking the rest of the day off except for scheduling some meetings.  Then I'm headed home to wash the road grime off, take a nap, make dinner, drink some beer, pet the dog, and kiss the lil' lady,

Speaking of the world's best dog, here's a link to a slideshow of some shots I took of her the other night:

Is it wrong to admit being more psyched about a Terry Gilliam film with Tom Waits than for Batman?

Though I'm totally going to see Batman. On IMAX if possible.

There was more than a little of Terry Gilliam's art direction sense in Hellboy. The movie was eh, but Ron Perlman is so great, as always.</br></br>

Bono Interviews Bob Dylan JULY 8, 1984

Bono: You have been to Ireland before, haven't you?

Dylan: Yeah, I was in Belfast and in Dublin, and we travelled around a little bit too.

Bono: Have you ever spent any time here? Have you ever been here on holiday?

Dylan: Yeah, well, when I was here, we travelled by car, so we stayed in different places - but Irish music has always been a great part of my life because I used to hang out with the Clancy Brothers. They influenced me tremendously.

Bono: Yeah, they have so much balls as a sound, you know, when they sing, it's like punk rock.

Dylan: Yeah, they were playing clubs as big as this room right here and the place - you couldn't put a pin in it, it would be so packed with people.

Bono: You could smell their breath?

Dylan: Yeah!

Bono: I bet you could. They blow you over with their lungs! God, I'd love to sing like that.

Dylan: Yeah, I spent years with them running around, 61, 62, 63.

Bono: Greenwich Village?

Dylan: All over the place, I played on the same bill with them once.

Bono: Get their autographs? (laughs)

Dylan: No, I didn't get their autograph. But you know one of the things I recall from that time is how great they all were - I mean there is no question, but that they were great. But Liam Clancy was always my favorite singer, as a ballad singer. I just never heard anyone as good, and that includes Barbara Streisand and Pearl Bailey.

Bono: You got to be careful here!

Dylan: He's just a phenomenal ballad singer.

Bono: Yeah, you know what I envy of you is that my music, and the music of U2 is like, it's in space somewhere. There is no particular musical roots or heritage that we plug into. In Ireland there is a tradition, but I've never plugged into it. It's like as if we're caught in space. There's a few groups now who are caught in space...

Dylan: Well, you have to reach back.

Bono: We never did play a 12 bar.

Dylan: You have to reach! There's another group I used to listen to called the McPeake Family. I don't know if you ever heard of them?

Bono: The McPeake Family! I'd love to have heard of them, with a name like that.

Dylan: They are great. Paddy Clancy recorded them. He had a label called Tradition Records, and he used to bring back these records; they recorded for Prestige at the time, and Tradition Records, his company. They were called The McPeake family. They were even more rural than the Clancy Brothers. The Clancy Brothers had always that touch of commerciality to them - you didn't mind it, but it was still there, whereas the McPeake Family sang with harps. The old man, he played the harp - and it was that (gestures) big - and the drums.

Bono: Were they a real family?

Dylan: Yeah, they were a real family; if you go to a record store and as for a McPeake Family record, I Don't know, I'm sure you could still get them in a lot of places.

Bono: Have you heard of an Irish group that are working now in this middle ground between traditional and contemporary music called Clannad? Clannad is Gaelic for family, and they've made some very powerful pieces of music, including a song called "Theme From Harry's Game", it's from a film, and it knocked over everyone in Europe. It didn't get played in the US. It's just vocal and they used some low bass frequencies in it as well - it's just beautiful. They're a family, they come from Donegal, and have worked from that same base of traditional music.

Dylan: There's a group you have here, what's it called, Plankston?

Bono: Planxty.

Dylan: They're great!

Bono: Another rock'n'roll band!

Dylan: Yeah, but when I think of what's happening - I think they're great.

Bono: There's another group called De Dannan. The name De Dannan has something to do with with the lost tribes of Dan. You heard of the disappearing tribe of Dan? They say they came from Ireland.

Dylan: Yeah, I've heard that, I've heard that.

Bono: I'm not a musicologist or expert in this area, but it would appear that this is true. Also, you know they say the Irish musical scale has no roots in Europe whatsoever, rather it comes from Africa and India. The Cartesian people, the Egyptian people, what gave them supremacy in the Middle East was the sail they developed. I forget what they call it, I forget the name of the sail, but this sail allowed them to become successful sea farers and traders and they dominated as a result of their reading, and that same sail which was used on those boats, is used on the West of Ireland.

Dylan: Is that right?

Bono: Bob Quinn made a film called Atlanteans in which this theory was elaborated. He suggests that the book of Kells, which is a manuscript, part of it has it's roots in Coptic script, not in Europe. It's not a European thing at all - it's linked from Africa, Spain, Brittany and Ireland, because that was a sea route. I'm not an expert. I shouldn't be talking about it really. But it's of interest when you think of it.

Dylan: Sure it is.

Bono: I might be able to send you over some tapes of that actually.

Dylan: I'd like to have them. You know Planxty? I also like Paul Brady a lot.

Bono: Yeah, he's great. He's a real song writer. Tell me - have you ever approached a microphone, not with words, but just to sing? I had to do this as a necessity once when some lyrics of mine were stolen - and I learnt to sing on the microphone just singing and working the words into it later. I find when I put a pen in my hand it gets in the way! Do you have words first?

Dylan: I do at certain times.

Bono: In Portland, Oregon a number of years ago two pretty girls walked in the dressing room, smiled and walked out with some of our songs, in a brief case.

Dylan: I used to have that happen to me all the time, except they used to take clothes!

Bono: Is that right?

Dylan: They used to take all my best clothes, but never took my songs.

Bono: After that we had to go in to record our second LP, October, without any songs - there was a lot of pressure. having to sing under that stress without any words, I found out a lot of things about myself that I didn't even know were there. I'd wondered, had some of the things that have come out of you ever been a surprise to you?

Dylan: That usually happens at concerts or shows I'm doing, more than recording studios, Also, I never sit around, I usually play ... I'll play my guitar, rather than just have something to say, to express myself. I can express it better with my guitar.

Bono: I wondered had the songs that you were writing ever frightened you in some way?

Dylan: Oh yeah, I've written some songs that that did that. The songs that I wrote for the 'Slow Train' album did that. I wrote those songs. I didn't plan to write them, but I wrote them anyway. I didn't like writing them, I didn't want to write them. I didn't figure ... I just didn't want to write them songs at that period of time. But I found myself writing these songs and after I had a certain amount of them, I thought I didn't want to sing them, so I had a girl sing them for me at the time, and what I wanted to do was .... she's a great singer ....

Bono: Who is this?

Dylan: A girl I was singing with at the time, Carolyn Dennis her name was. I gave them all to her and had her record them, and not even put my name on them. But I wanted the songs out; I wanted them out, but *I* didn't want to do it because I knew that it wouldn't be perceived in that way. It would just mean more pressure. I just did not want that at that time.

Bono: But are you a trouble maker? Is there something in you that wants trouble that an album like 'Slow Train' stirs up? Do you wanna fight? Do you wanna box!?

Dylan: I don't know! I mean, I wanna piss people off once in a while, but boxing or fighting - it would be an exercise to do it. You know, I love to do it, but not with anything at stake.

Bono: Chess, do you play chess?

Dylan: Yeah, I play chess. Are you a chess player?

Bono: I am a chess player.

Dylan: I'm not that good actually.

Bono: I'll challenge you to a game of chess.

Dylan: I don't have it right now actually, I just don't have one on me, but the next time you see me!

Bono: Oh, you can get these little ones you know, that you can carry around.

Dylan: Yeah, I take them on tour all the time, but nobody in the band will play me.

Bono: Really?

Dylan: Yeah, they say it's an ego trip. They say I want to win, I don't want to win, I just like to play.

Bono: When you put out a record that causes trouble - is it part of an overall plan, or do you just do it?

Dylan: No, I don't ever put out a record to cause trouble - if it causes trouble, it causes trouble, that's apart from me. If it causes trouble, that's other people's problem. It's not my problem. I'm just not going to put out a record that I just feel - you know, if I feel like I'm inspired to make a statement, I'll make that statement. But what happens after I do it, I don't care about that.

Bono: What's your opening game?

Dylan: My opening game, you mean king's pawn up two - and all that? I don't know.

Bono: You just takes it as it comes.

Dylan: Yeah. I don't really play that seriously.

Bono: Well, I thought I did until I played Adam's brother Sebastian - he was only about 13 years old and he beat me!

Dylan: Somebody may have a chess game here.

Bono: I'd love to play.

searching for a chess board ... enter Van Morrison

Bono: You haven't used any synthesizers on your records so far?

Dylan: No, I've never used those machines.

Bono: The Fairlight Music Computer - have you heard of that?

Dylan: Fairlight?

Bono: Van, what do you think of electronic music?

Morrison: I like the music Brian Eno plays.

Bono: He speaks very highly of you. He's producing our record right now.

Morrison: Say hello.

Bono: (to Bob) Do you know Brian Eno?

Dylan: Brian Eno? I don't know Brian Eno, but I know some of his work.

Bono: When you're working with a producer, do you give him the lee-way to challenge you?

Dylan: Yeah, if he feels like it. But usually we just go into the studio and sing a song, and play the music, and have, you know ...

Bono: Have you had somebody in the last five years who said "That's crap, Bob"?

Dylan: Oh, they say that all the time!

Bono: Mark Knopfler, did he say that?

Dylan: I don't know, they spend time getting their various songs right, but with me, I just take a song into the studio and try to rehearse it, and then record it, and then do it. It's a little harder now though to make a good record - even if you've got a good song and a good band. Even if you go in and record it live, it's not gonna sound like it used to sound, because the studios now are so modern, and overly developed, that you can take anything good and you can press it and squeeze it and squash it, and constipate it and suffocate it. You do a great performance in the studio and you listen back to it because the speakers are all so good, but, ah, no!

Bono: All technology does is - you go into a dead room with dead instruments and you use technology to give it life that it doesn't have, and then it comes out of the speakers and you believe it. What I've been trying to do is find a room that has life in itself.

Dylan: Yeah.

Bono: A 'living' room.

Dylan: The machines though, can even take the life out of that room, I've found. You can record in St Peter's Cathedral, you know, and they still make it sound like, eh, ...

Bono: Somebody's backyard.

Dylan: Yeah.

Dylan: That's a good idea. I'd love to record in a cathedral.

Dylan: You know the studios in the old days were all much better, and the equipment so much better, there's no question about it in my mind. You just walked into a studio, they were just big rooms, you just sang, you know, you just made records; and they sounded like the way they sounded there. That stopped happening in the late Sixties, for me anyway. I noticed the big change. You go into a studio now and they got rugs on the floor, settees and pinball machines and videos and sandwiches coming every ten minutes. It's a big expensive party and you're lucky if you come out with anything that sounds decent.

Bono: Yeah, records haven't got better, have they?

Dylan: No, you go in now, you got your producer, you got your engineer, you got your assistant engineer, usually your assistant producer, you got a guy carrying the tapes around. I mean, you know, there's a million people go into recording just an acoustic song on your guitar. The boys turn the machines on and it's a great undertaking.

Bono: There's a system called Effanel which Mick Fleetwood from Fleetwood Mac brought to Africa. It was built for him because he wanted to get some real African drummin', for "Tusk". We've used that system. It comes in a light suitcase, very small, no bullshit studio, and it just arrives, you can literally bring it to your living room.

Morrison: I think all the same they'll go back to 2-track eventually.

Bono: There's a guy called Conny Plank, who lives in Germany. He's a producer I think. He produced Makem and Clancy and some Irish traditional bands, also orchestral and funnily enough a lot of the new electronic groups, DAF, Ultravox, and so on. He used to record orchestras by just finding a position in the room where they were already balanced and he applies this in his thinking, in recording modern music: he finds a place in the room where it's already mixed.

Morrison: I don't know, when I started we didn't think about that! You didn't even think about recording ... (laughs)

Bono: You didn't even think!

Morrison: You didn't even know what was on the cards. One day you were in the room, they turned the tape on. After about eight hours or so, they'd say, 'OK, tea break, it's over'.

Dylan: Yeah, next song, next song!

Morrison: And that was that - it was an album.

Dylan: Yeah, you'd make an album on three days or four days and it was over - if that many! It's that long now ... it takes four days to get a drum sound.

Bono: Do you know the Monty Python team, they're comedians, British comedians, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. They have a sketch that reminds me of you guys - sitting back talking of days gone by: "You tell that to the young people of today and they'd never believe you". But you can't go backwards, you must go forward. You try to bring the values that were back there, you know, the strength, and if you see something that was lost, you got to find a new way to capture that same strength. Have you any idea of how to do that? I think you've done it by the way ... I think 'Shot Of Love', that opening track has that.

Dylan: I think so too, You're one of the few people to say that to me about that record, to mention that record to me.

Bono: That has *that* feeling.

Dylan: It's a great record, it suits just about everybody.

Bono: The sound from that record makes me feel like I'm in the same room as the other musicians. I don't feel like they're over *there*. Some of our records, I feel like they're over there because we got into this cinema type sound, not bland like FM sound, but we got into this very broad sound. Now we're trying to focus more of a punch, and that's what we are after, this intimacy .... I've never interviewed anybody before, by the way. I hate being interviewed myself.

Morrison: You're doing a good job!

Bono: Is this OK?. Good! What records do you listen to?

Dylan: What records do I listen to? New records? I don't know, just the old records really. Robert Johnson. I still listen to those records that I listened to when I was growing up - they really changed my life. They still change my life. They still hold up, you know. The Louvain Brothers, Hank Williams, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Charlie Patton, I always liked to listen to him.

Bono: I just bought Woody Guthrie's 'Bound For Glory'. I'm just a beginner when it comes to America. I mean, it's changed me. When you go the US, coming from this country, it's more than a different continent ....

Morrison: It's shell shock.

Bono: Yeah, coming from troubled Ireland, it's the real shell shock! I'm just getting acquainted with American music and literature. Do you still see Allen Ginsberg?

Dylan: I run across Allen from time to time, yeah, Gregory Corsos's back now, he's doing some readings, I think he's just published a new book.

Bono: I've just been reading this book 'Howl'.

Dylan: Oh, that's very powerful. That's another book that changed me. 'Howl', 'On the Road', 'Dharma Bums'.

Morrison: (to Bono) Have you read 'On the Road'?

Bono: Yes I have, I'm just starting that. You have a reference in one of your songs to John Donne, 'Rave On John Donne'. Have you read his poetry?

Morrison: I was reading it at the time.

Dylan: (to Bono) You heard the songs - Brendan Behan's songs?

Bono: Yeah.

Dylan: 'Royal Canal', you know the 'Royal Canal'?

Morrison: His brother wrote it. His name is Dominic.

Dylan: Oh, Dominic wrote 'Royal Canal'?

Bono: You know Brendan's son hang out around here in Dublin. He's a good guy, I believe.

Dylan: I know the solo lyrics to the 'Royal Canal'. I used to sing it all the time.

Bono: How does it go?

Dylan: (sings) 'The hungry feeling came over me stealing, as the mice were squalling in my prison cell'.

Bono: That's right, yeah!

Dylan: (continues) 'That old triangle went jingle jangle, all along the banks of the Royal Canal'.

Bono: That's right, when did you read that?

Dylan: (there's no way stopping him now) 'In the female prison there's seventy women. It's all over there that I want to dwell. And that old triangle goes jingle jangle, all along the banks of the Royal Canal'.

Bono: Have you been to the Royal Canal?

Dylan: No I used to sing that song though. Every night.

Bono: Our music - as I was saying earlier - it doesn't have those roots.

Morrison: Yeah, there was a break in the lineage. I sussed that out when I went to see Thin Lizzy years ago, the first night in L.A. and I was watching at the back of the stage and I realized that the music was a complete cut in the connection between the end of the Sixties and the middle of the Seventies - a severing of the traditional lineage of groups.

Bono: I like to know more about roots music. I'm hungry for a past.

Morrison: You know you should listen to some of that stuff.

Bono: I will. I've been listening to some gospel music, you know, like the Swan Silvertones, and stuff like that.

Dylan: That's US stuff though.


Morrison: US stuff, but the British stuff you should listen to, you know, like some of the old stuff, like the Yardbirds.

Bono: Yeah, I've got some of their tapes recently, some real good tapes.

Dylan: You can still hear the McPeakes. The next generation may not be able to though. Who knows? I would hate to think that. Listen we're gonna have to get ready to play. Are you gonna stay for the show?

Bono: Certainly, that's what I'm here for actually.

Dylan: To record it, HA!

Conducted at the Slane Castle, Dublin, Ireland prior to Dylan's show. Both Bono and Van Morrison were later guests at the show, Van Morrison doing his usual It's All Over Now, Baby Blue and Bono joining Dylan on Blowin' In The Wind.

I know, Peep Show!  The quotes you picked are just so awesome.  Have you seen Mark's bit about the two different kinds of toast yet?  We had to rewind that several times.

Yes, the preview aspect of that discussion was indeed interesting, and I see what you mean about reverse-engineering roots.  

Are you an ice cream aficionado?  If so, and if you like chocolate ice cream in particular, you must try Hagen Das's "Amazon Valley Chocolate."  It's is without a doubt the best chocolate ice cream I've ever tasted.  We bought an ice cream maker last summer because I eat so much and it was getting too expensive.  I can make a wicked vanilla or peach or strawberry, but so far do dice re. chocolate.  Not sure I need to bother with Amazon Valley out there.  If I could get all of my nutrition from ice cream, that's all I'd eat.</br></br>

Lord that's genius.

Actually, right now I'm saying about the same thing except it's Ben & Jerry's and Peep Show.

"Oh my God it's the last days of Rome! I've been initiated! Fuck the police!"

"Wow, fuck you lord of death, I'm still full of piss and vinegar."

Man, I would LOVE to read the Roth v Waits interview. I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened. Can we make that happen? I bet we can. All we need is a blog, right? That would be awesome.

Actually, that mag called The Believer runs things much like that.

As for U2, the detour started with The Joshua Tree. I liked them when they were from space. I started to dislike them when they tried to reverse-engineer roots. This interview was 1984, so I assumed they'd already recorded TUF then. Odd how the interview was at Slane Castle, though, no? And it was so interesting to hear Bono and the others basically reveal previews of where they were headed.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I was commenting to Chesley that brain science is one of the last truly exciting areas of scientific investigation.  There is so much more that we don't know than that we do.  It's staggering.  I think about it all the time.  Sometimes I wish I had the kind of mind that makes for a good neuroscientist, but I don't think I do.  

I read recently that people who have strokes in the left side of the brain--the logical, language-producing side--although they can't talk, and although others assume they're locked in some horribly claustrophobic  mental jail cell, are experiencing a kind of wordless bliss a lot of the time.  The right brain is just such a nicer place to be!  Imagine if the word machine really did get shut down!

Two things that blow me away about the brain:

> The relative organization of memory. The specifics of how memories are encoded, stored, and recalled remain largely mysterious.  But there it is.  No zeroes or ones.  Prone to wild distortion, but sometimes quite accurate.  I often think about how remembering an event takes only a tiny fraction of the time over which the event itself unfolded.  So memories are kind of like journal abstracts of the events they recall.  What if every time we remembered something we remembered it in real time?  Memory would soon soak up all of our mental resources.  I've read that current thinking about memory storage is that it takes place in networks of neurons related to the kind of event being remembered.  So, the memory of a smell is stored somewhere in the brain's olfactory apparatus while visual memories are stored in the occipital lobe.  But who knows.

> The persistence of consciousness.  I've attempted to read some in the philosophy of consciousness but can't make heads or tails of any of it.  Even so I am often flat-out blown away by the fact that we remain one being for the most part.  I guess we've discussed this to some extent.  You sent that Wallace Shawn interview.  But it really is freaky that an individual's intelligence, personality, memory, creativity, and so on remain stable when they're all completely dependent on billions of neuron's sodium/potassium pumps and the electrical impulses they generate.  Doesn't it seem more likely that these things would go haywire and that we'd be someone different every morning when we woke up?

i basicall yhad a good time. I'm pretty easy on movies. Usually the cracks don't start to show for a couple days afterwards.

</b> <br><br> Interesting re. TW.  I know, it really does sound like Frank's Wild Years.  Or the whole of Nighthawks at the Diner.

There were some cool things about it, but I just got really bored.  I'm easy on movies too--like you, I just want to see shit get blown up!!!  Even so, I think the whole Two Face aspect could have been eliminated and 30-40 minutes left out.

I am about 95% certain that an IMAX movie would cause my dear wife to puke her guts out.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> The other night I couldn't sleep, so I started brainstorming reality show ideas.  Here are a few:

1.  GRANDMASTERS! 

Basically just a chess competition, but with stupid play-by-play commentary, stupid visual and audio effects, post-elimination tearful interviews, and so on.  Plus all the chess masters live together in a big, stupid mansion in which every room has a checkerboard floor of some kind.

2.  JIGSAW HODOWN!

Combination jigsaw puzzle and square-dancing tournament.  Contestants live together and must wear bandanas at all times.  Sets based on Hee-Haw.  Offsite visits to great jigsaw puzzle and square dancing locations across the U.S.

3.  FATTY FATTY TWO BY FOUR

Overly skinny contestants compete to gain the most weight.  Plus they live together.

4.  ARE YOU SMARTER THAN THE PRESIDENT?

Self-explanatory.

5.  MEET THE PRESS SECRETARY

Contestants have to handle a ruthless press corps made up of real journalists, but are not told the topic before taking the podium.  Think Ms. South Carolina, "Such as...and so on."

6.  THE OLDEST PROFESSION

Self-explanatory

7.  SENIOR MOMENTS

A group of several elderly couples and a few eligible single elders live together under the same roof, in, say, a big stupid mansion.  Each contestant has a variety of medical problems, but no two people have the same conditions.  Hopefully you'd find a couple where the man had erectile dysfunction and the woman was taking hormones that made her horny.  And so on.  This is my favorite one, which is why I saved it for last.

Anyhow, if you want a small kick, listen to MAKE IT RAIN.  Tap out the beat on your thigh for the first 20 seconds or so, and remember the feeling.  At around 2:50 into the song, skip back to the beginning.

</b> <br><br> Wow, Bob, I'm sorry to hear it's so rough.  The money piece is so awful; I'm perpetually in the same boat.  I think that the worries created by an ongoing lack of money are deeply existential as they include fears about food and shelter.  I'm convinced that such worries unhinge us in ways we can't know.  It's destabilizing and makes everything harder.  I don't know about you, but when I'm flush with cash (which only happens but rarely) I just feel better...more confident.

When you say you need a job, do you mean like a job job where you go and sit down every day or like a writing gig?  Any prospects?

I don't have the Ribot record you mentioned.  But I do know that the guitar solo in HANG DOWN YOUR HEAD is the best rock guitar solo ever.

I hope things lighten up for you.</br></br>

<b> Aug 19, 2008, at 12:42 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I think you can really hear the influence of (what I take to be) his son on this record, what with the looped samples of himself and a lot of the tropes of hip hop. Not sure if it works for me but big points for the attempt.

That said, I haven't really listened that closely either. But now I'm eager to try the thing you just suggested.

Marc Ribot is from Mars. I love him. I would have no idea how to do what he does. You have that Los Prostizos Cubanos record he did? Love that record.

I feel like I'm chipping away at the love interest. We had a really good coffee last Tuesday. But I  can't tell yet. I admire her more and more. Which is a deadly situation for my heart.

I dunno man. Yesterday was a real low moment. I have like a hundred bucks and a mountain of debt. Prospects seem grim. Even my other friends who are in a tight place have someone to fall back on - spouses, mostly, or family.  I just kinda feel like I'm losing big at the blackjack table, putting in my watch, my rings, the family heirlooms. It's ridiculous though. I just need a friggin job, mainly. And it would help if I could find a good match, lady-wise.

Reading Buechner every day. He's the only one who cuts through the fog.

Maybe today will be better. I kinda have to think so.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Dear Friends:

I've never had a problem paying federal income taxes, but I'm so upset about this $700 Billion Wall Street bailout that I believe threatening to withhold my 2008 federal taxes is completely legitimate.

It's not a matter of my opposing some kind of action being taken--it's obvious that something must be done--but the executive branch's insistence that Congress should once again butt-out of its plans looks like the beginning of the worst constitutional debacle the U.S. has ever faced.  This is something that republicans, democrats, and all who are passionately devoted to democracy can agree on.

It wouldn't be very effective for a single person to communicate to his representatives in the House and Senate that s/he will refuse to pay federal income taxes if the executive manages to squash debate.  But what if 50- or 100,000 of us managed?  What if 1,000,000 or more made those calls?

Let's call our representatives on THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23 and say, "If Congress does not have sufficient time to execute its constitutionally mandated oversight role with regard to the proposed $700 Wall Street bailout, I will refuse to pay my federal income taxes in 2008."

</b> <br><br> Herb Alpert was Nick Cave's first favorite musician.  He just loved him when he was a young kid.  Couldn't get enough.  He lived in a small town, and Herb Alpert sounded like a great big world to him.  It was so funny to hear him talking about that.  I love listening to Nick Cave interviews from the last several (i.e. clean) years.  He's incredibly charming and soft spoken.

</b> <br><br> Makes perfect sense to me that it would be relieving.  For the most part I think of people who kill themselves as having died from a disease.    That's definitely a different matter from someone killing himself as some kind of "sane" objection to how things stand.

I've been writing a lot of limericks recently.  As a hobby I'm trying to craft the most perfectly vulgar limerick ever conceived.  I want each word to communicate something disgusting.  It's harder than you might think.  Anyway, here's another one:

There once was a man from Cape Cod'n
who was perpetually sodd'n.
One night while quite drunk
he buttfucked a skunk,
and said, "My, but that pussy smells rodd'n."

It wasn't exactly that Twin Peaksy but I did get a bit of a jolt when my mental pictures of all these people got an instant and brutal updating as soon as I walked in. I'm sure it went both ways. Although I'm now considerably skinnier than I was in high school. Less hair though. 

I haven't heard much about Ricky and substances. But he wasn't particularly drunk even at his party. And he came over here a month or so ago and only had a couple of beers. He and [ugh - his wife, whose name I've already forgotten since I've only met her at the wedding] are moving down to San Clemente where her dad has a construction business. Ricky's working for him. So he seems pretty together.

Bailey I know about. Is there a Bankston? Or is that just to sound snooty? I'd prefer if it were merely to sound snooty. If you have a partner named Bankston you should fire him and keep the name. And you should have crumpets precisely at 2pm every afternoon. And wear a monocle.

<b> Oct 14, 2008, at 9:47 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Here's the pitch for a documentary on this subject I sent to my friend Josie--the one who was nominated for an oscar last year for her work on War Dance.

I heard you're moving back to Nebraska soon--are you going to Omaha, which I've heard is a really great place to live?  That's a really big change!

I'm writing to pitch an idea for a documentary.  I'm sure you are deluged with such things, but I have a story that seems like it could be both satisfying to pursue and entertaining to watch.  It has to do with my father's family, and it involves medical/religious missionaries in northeastern India (near Myanmar) at the turn of the 20th century, elephants and pet bears, serious mental illness, scandal, alteration of birth documents, multiple family secrets taken to the grave, a few noble decisions by unexpected players, and several as-yet unsolved mysteries.

I imagine that everyone thinks his family is interesting enough that other people would want to watch a movie about it, but I never would have thought so about mine until the secrets starting spilling following the death of my grandmother (actually my great aunt, as it turns out) a few years ago.  In any case, I think the story is interesting beyond my own feelings in that it deals with some pretty large and universal themes most people can relate to.  I'd be happy to spell some of those themes out if you're interested.

I understand that you're about to get started on a significant new project, but do you think this could have any potential at some point?

<Email Signature.jpg></br></br>

<b> Oct 14, 2008, at 11:43 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Yeah, you're thinking along the same lines that I have been, only better.

Just to clarify, Riley didn't die poor and alone.  He and his wife Anna had eight kids in India.  One was Edith.  Back in the U.S. after Riley's death, and living with her mother in Detroit, Edith got pregnant by Claude Bankston.  They had been very happy together and had planned to marry.  The pregnancy changed that.  The family squeezed Bankston out of the picture and essentially shunned Edith after she gave birth to my father.  Edith's sister Eleanor adopted my father right out of Edith's arms, and never told him that she was his aunt, although he did know he was adopted.  The mechanism by which my father learned the truth is incredibly improbable and convoluted and did not come to pass until just a few years ago.  

Really telling some of the important parts of this story requires a family tree diagram, I have found through experience.

Riley died in India in 1928 of enteric fever.  He was camping with some British government officials, and they had a new coolie who didn't understand that the westerners needed their water boiled, not just heated up.  

Edith had psychotic mental health problems like mine, my aunt's, and my sister's.  There is evidence that Riley had crippling depression--The Banyan Tree has an account of a "nervous and physical breakdown" in 1925 during which he could neither speak nor move.  The Nagas made a kind of litter with a mattress on it and carried him down the mountain on top of it so that he could get treatment in Calcutta.

So far as I know, Edith died in some kind of institution/home for the indigent elderly in 1989.  That was in Lowell, Mass.

Virtually nothing is known about Claude Bankston.

The Bailey clan were all very religious and guarded their secrets like the mob.

Edith looked almost completely unlike any of her 7 siblings.  They were all brown-haired, brown-eyed, and had giant protruding ears--very homely people.  She was blonde, had blue eyes, and was quite attractive.  There were several (single) nurses involved in the settlement, one of whom, Miss Stevensen, fell very much out of Riley's wife's favor.  What does all that make you think of?

May I share another crazy detail re. the Baileys or are you sick of this sheeeeeit?
<Email Signature.jpg></br></br>

<b> Oct 14, 2008, at 3:14 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Okay, got it.  Here's another detail:

As you can see below, Eleanor (my biological great aunt) was married twice.  Harry killed himself at some point in the mid/late 60's.  In the mid/late 70s she married a man named Fred Kemp, a catholic widower with scads of children throughout metro DC.  I don't think Fred could read, but he sure was nice to me.

Very late in their lives, when they were going down the tubes, Fred was going faster than Eleanor.  She expended the little energy she had bathing him and whatnot.  My father felt it was time for them both to move to a nursing home, but one of Fred's daughers, CHERYL, vehemently disagreed.  Bad blood ensued between my dad and Cheryl.  

Eleanor died suddenly in the midst of this.  My dad didn't have much to do with Fred and family after that.  I was the only McCready at his funeral.  Bad blood, really bad blood.

Fast forward 5 years or so.

Cheryl, now retired in Florida, had a secret she couldn't bear keeping.  She flew to DC, went to see my dad's sister Joyce, and told her that in her father's dying moments he had a moment of perfect lucidity during which he told Cheryl the truth about my father's (and Joyce's) parentage.  He also said that Eleanor had made him swear to take the secret to his grave, but that he just couldn't do it.  He died at about 100 years old.

<b> Oct 14, 2008, at 3:34 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Well, this brings up another crazy point.

As I've mentioned, Aunt Joyce is profoundly mentally ill.  I think of her as having a mental diagnosis that no longer exists, technically--hebephrenia.  See description below.  She functions pretty well, all things considered.  Keeps a job, married, kids.

Because of her problems, my father long took solace in the belief that they were genetically unrelated.  Growing up, it was frequently made quite clear that we weren't blood relatives with Joyce. She was adopted roughly 10 years after my dad.

As it turns out, though, Edith had also given birth to Joyce.  God knows who the father was.  Eleanor repeated the adoption routine, and Edith vanished into obscurity.  So my dad and my aunt are half-siblings.


HEBEPHRENIA

A form of schizophrenia in which affective changes are prominent, delusions and hallucinations fleeting and fragmentary, behaviour irresponsible and unpredictable, and mannerisms common. The mood is shallow and inappropirate and often accompanied by giggling or self-satisfied, self-absorbed smiling, or by a lofty manner, grimaces, mannerisms, pranks, hypochondriacal complaints, and reiterated phrases. Thought is disorganized and speech rambling and incoherent.

Docs are funny things. They gotta be pegged to some larger issue in order to get any play at all. Or just be deeply weird. To me this feels more like an historical epic kind of novel / film. 

Depends on what the actual order of the historical events are, but knowing very little about it my take is: 

People come up to your dad in some tiny Indian village, having walked days through the mountains  just to touch a descendent of RILEY BAILEY. This sets up the question: Who was Riley Bailey? Which we then go back in time to answer and to show how he started out some yutz in Poughkeepsie or wherever, had huge crazy adventures that in an unexpected way changed him into a guy who would go to India for the sake of these people, and because he did go there, people still revere his name. The most poignant aspect, of course, being that he died broke, alone, and forgotten among his own people. It's bookended by your dad, or that's a modern-day thread that we keep returning to when needed. Sort of like "Atonement" or something (though I can't remember if it actually used that structure).</br></br>

BUT, the northeastern corner of India is majority christian, and I believe, majority baptist, to this day.

Before the baptists got there, the Naga people were animists and headhunters.  HEADHUNTERS!  Anyway, the British govt had tried to eradicate headhunting in the late 19th century, but I'm pretty sure it was still going on to some extent in the early 20th century.

You should have seen my grandmother's tiny Rockville, MD basement when I was a kid.  It smelled like an old lady's basement.  But it had the skin of an enormous snake on the wall, a giant elephant's foot, a stuffed bear, and a stuffed leopard or tiger.  Weird!</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: But wait, THERE'S MORE!
</b> <br><br> Okay, got it.  Here's another detail:

As you can see below, Eleanor (my biological great aunt) was married twice.  Harry killed himself at some point in the mid/late 60's.  In the mid/late 70s she married a man named Fred Kemp, a catholic widower with scads of children throughout metro DC.  I don't think Fred could read, but he sure was nice to me.

Very late in their lives, when they were going down the tubes, Fred was going faster than Eleanor.  She expended the little energy she had bathing him and whatnot.  My father felt it was time for them both to move to a nursing home, but one of Fred's daughers, CHERYL, vehemently disagreed.  Bad blood ensued between my dad and Cheryl.  

Eleanor died suddenly in the midst of this.  My dad didn't have much to do with Fred and family after that.  I was the only McCready at his funeral.  Bad blood, really bad blood.

Fast forward 5 years or so.

Cheryl, now retired in Florida, had a secret she couldn't bear keeping.  She flew to DC, went to see my dad's sister Joyce, and told her that in her father's dying moments he had a moment of perfect lucidity during which he told Cheryl the truth about my father's (and Joyce's) parentage.  He also said that Eleanor had made him swear to take the secret to his grave, but that he just couldn't do it.  He died at about 100 years old.</br></br>

<b>  October 14, 2008 at 3:34:22 PM PDT
 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: But wait, THERE'S MORE!
</b> <br><br> Well, this brings up another crazy point.

As I've mentioned, Aunt Joyce is profoundly mentally ill.  I think of her as having a mental diagnosis that no longer exists, technically--hebephrenia.  See description below.  She functions pretty well, all things considered.  Keeps a job, married, kids.

Because of her problems, my father long took solace in the belief that they were genetically unrelated.  Growing up, it was frequently made quite clear that we weren't blood relatives with Joyce. She was adopted roughly 10 years after my dad.

As it turns out, though, Edith had also given birth to Joyce.  God knows who the father was.  Eleanor repeated the adoption routine, and Edith vanished into obscurity.  So my dad and my aunt are half-siblings.


HEBEPHRENIA

A form of schizophrenia in which affective changes are prominent, delusions and hallucinations fleeting and fragmentary, behaviour irresponsible and unpredictable, and mannerisms common. The mood is shallow and inappropirate and often accompanied by giggling or self-satisfied, self-absorbed smiling, or by a lofty manner, grimaces, mannerisms, pranks, hypochondriacal complaints, and reiterated phrases. Thought is disorganized and speech rambling and incoherent.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> No, he's a full nephew to Eleanor.  Her sister was his mom.


YES IT IS CONFUSING!</br></br>

<b>  October 14, 2008 at 3:38:23 PM PDT
 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Clarification
</b> <br><br> Just to be clear, Joyce was just as unrelated to Fred Kemp as my dad.  The relationship was like a step father, except that both my dad and his sister were totally grown and on their own when Eleanor married Fred.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Re: But wait, THERE'S MORE!
</b> <br><br> Oh, yeah.  I'm not used to thinking of that as a fact, and in the absence of proof, it's hard to assert as such.  Mendelian genetics do allow for a blue-eyed offspring of a blue-eyed father and brown-eyed mother.  So, it's far from certain re. Miss Stevensen.  It's more of a hunch.

I kind of suspect that the American Baptist Foreign Mission Board might have more about all of this in their archives, but nothing about it was included in the dossier they sent me.  I wonder what they've got on Miss Stevensen.  Might be worth my asking.

Apparently, though, this mafia-like secretiveness was a Bailey trait beyond just Eleanor.  My mother told me recently that the great matriarch, Anna (Riley's wife) took a secret to her grave.  She let on that there was a secret, but that's it.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I've traced the Baileys back to Ireland, and Ireland is, of course, infamous for its high prevalence of schizophrenia.  There's nothing as valuable to a psychiatric geneticist as a pair of identical schizophrenic Irish twins separated at birth.

It's also said that Riley's Aunt Fannie was nuts.  She'd have been a mid 19th-century figure, I guess.</br></br>

honestly, the way the business works is that stories like this most often appear first as novels and then are adapted into films (often not as good as the book). the biz likes to know that a story has the imprimateur of some other commercial entity (publishing house, prestigious magazine) before it bites. lessens the risk -- or so they perceive.

<b> Oct 20, 2008, at 2:45 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> This is an interesting conundrum.

I would guess that a press release probably won't get you anywhere. Just based on my own dealings with press releases as the guardian of the fax machine at the Style section of the Post.

However, if you can identify specific writers or sections of the paper and figure some hook to get their attention, then you've got a good shot. It's got to be something sexier and more specific than Guy Makes Furniture. Like you're the torchbearer for a dying art, or you got some particularly interesting and challenging gig with unusual aspects to it, or you provide some service that is hard to come by, or even just the apparent contradiction of: trained jazz guy and indie rocker gives up PhD studies to make nifty furniture because it's beautiful, or whatever. Also, dunno what yr current portfolio looks like but maybe there's some angle that could pit your work against shitty Ikea / Crate & Barrel stuff, you know, as the "alternative" furniture, or the actually stylish option instead of cookie cutter,  or soemthing.

Basically, some unique angle that makes it imperative that you be written about.

I think press releases are basically useless. They get tossed / deleted. Best to put that energy toward identifying specific targets and crafting some possible angles they'd go for.</br></br>

<b> Oct 20, 2008, at 3:17 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Things = so much better simply because I have paying work. Actually, so little has changed that it's absurd to realize that the absence of a looming threat is all it takes to make me basically  happy.

<b> Oct 21, 2008, at 2:53 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I think that quartet lives here in L.A. I feel pretty certain I've met someone in that group and had to be all gracious about their method of making their living. I think they also do, like, Pink Floyd and shit.</br></br>

<b> Oct 24, 2008, at 7:17 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> a quote from david harrington that sadly is not gonna make it in the piece i'm writing today about the kronos quartet:

The reason we got into playing purple haze by jimi hendrix in the late 70s is bec people were saying the orchs in the united states were gonna fold, and I got to thinking, shit I gotta play the rite of spring, I’ve never played it. So I got a friend to make a version for kronos. And I was thinking what if they want an encore, what are we gonna do after the rite of spring? That’s how we got into playing hendrix.</br></br>

dude. both those last talk talk albums and the mark hollis album sound SO GOOD turned up loud. someone really outdid themselves in the recording of that (phill brown, i guess). you can hear chairs squeak, breaths, odd guitar mistakes, and the opening minute of one of those talk talk records (forget which) is just amp vibrato. you can only hear it if it's up loud or on headphones.

Things = even keel. Nothing dramatic to report. Except it's drizzling here a bit.

I think TVOTR are a pretty hot band, on record. Live, not so much. Well, to be fair, I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl as the first of three acts and they simply weren't an arena-sized band. They're probably pretty smokin' in a club.

They have a lot of musical ideas. Not really clear if they have anything to say, but I haven't paid close attention to their new record yet.</br></br>

<b> Nov 2, 2008, at 5:22 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> No, I can't tell to whom you forwarded it, specifically.  But I can tell that two people in CA viewed the site yesterday, one in West Hollywood (you, I guess) and another in Beverly Hills.  I was then able to drill down on the Beverly Hills visitor to determine that his/her domain was 20th Century Fox.  Since only 10 people or so went to the site yesterday, I assumed that the second CA hit came from you.  The miracles of Google Analytics!

I'm glad to hear that things are on an even keel.  What a good feeling.

I'm enjoying the new TV record a lot, not having paid much attention before.  They seem like something special to me, sonically.

<b> Nov 3, 2008, at 1:51 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hm. West Hollywood wasn't me. I'm way east of Hollywood. Though I did look at the site. But yeah, Fox is most likely my friend Cate who's asst editing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL for Fox. (A movie which is likely to suck, btw.)

Seems like TVOTR consistently release songs that make me stop what I'm doing and go: who is this? So that's a good sign, particularly since so much indie rock is bland.

I'm going to see Van Morrison play Astral Weeks at the Hollywood Bowl on Friday. I'm trying to keep my expectations low since I love that record so much and Van is known for spotty performances. But still.

</b> <br><br> I think West Hollywood could be you, actually--sometimes people's servers are across town.  So if I track myself, I can show up in Glen Allen or something.  

TVOTR completely rules.  I've listened to Dear Science straight through seven or eight times and cannot wait to get everything else they've done.  The remixes and outtakes are very, very worthwhile, possibly even better than the album tracks in a couple of instances.  

Van Morrison playing Astral Weeks!  Holy crap, can I come?

You mentioned voting tomorrow...there's an election?

Don't know if I forwarded this to you already or not, but below is a message I sent to the Chicago critics who do "Sound Opinions" and the Tribune critic Greg Kott's response.

Nick Cave Sob Story!

Dear Jim, Greg, Todd, Robin, and Jason,

I've been very flattered by the inclusion of my comments in your show over the past year--once about The Smiths' rhythm section and once about the magnitude of Nick Cave's artistic development.  It's Nick I'm writing about today, and boy do I ever have a sob story for you!

One of my wife Chesley's life-long dreams is to see Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds live, and I was thrilled to tell her this past summer that they were coming to D.C., only a couple of hours from our home in Richmond, VA.  We bought tickets immediately and started a mental set list of stuff we hoped to hear.  It turned out that Chesley's identical twin sister was getting married up in Massachusetts the day before the show (The date was set after we'd already bought the tickets).  You don't miss your twin's wedding for anything--not even a Nick Cave show--so we figured we'd fly out of D.C., returning first thing Sunday morning to catch the show at the 9:30 club that night.  We are completely broke, and both the airline and show tickets were bought with our meager home equity line.  I wouldn't want you think we're some kind of jet-setters.  Alas, we certainly are not.

Unfortunately, Chesley's relatives, with whom we'd shared a rental car, ran exceedingly late on Sunday morning.  Neither Chesley nor I have ever missed a flight in the past, but we missed ours that morning.  We were on the standby list at 2:30, 4:30, and 7:00, but didn't make it onto any of those flights.  Instead of seeing Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on October 5, we were marooned at an airport Comfort Inn (another $150 expense we couldn't afford).  Full or regret, we called the 9:30 club to ask if they could release the tickets to anyone desperately wanting to get in to the sold-out show.  Then we went and ate at the motel's restaurant.  It was bleak.

Okay, I know everyone has a sad story, and I can't expect this cold world to salve my dear wife's wounds, but I thought this might at least be worth a try.  I'm not going to tell Chesley that I've sent this email.  I'm just going to give you her contact info, and if you feel inclined to mention any of this to Mr. Cave, and if he feels in any way moved to respond...well that would be a splendid consolation prize.

If my putting this to you is out-of-bounds, I really do apologize.  I love your show, and Chesley and I both love Nick Cave's work.

Highest regards,

Tim McCready

Tim:
 
Sorry to hear that. A Nick Cave concert is a life-changing experience, so we feel your pain.
 
Will ship your note to Mr. Cave's publicist with our hearty recommendation that it be forwarded to the man himself. He is well-insulated from the real world by his minions, but maybe we can penetrate his wall of handlers. After that, we'll see what happens.
 
Thanks for the loyal listenership. We appreciate it.

I simply cannot understand why he wasn't hospitalized at the end.  The only semi-reasonable explanation I can think of for staying out of the hospital in that situation is that no hospital will admit you because of your lack of insurance.  That happens all the time, and people die because of it.  But there was plenty of money and plenty of intelligence and care in his situation.  Why on earth wasn't he hospitalized?  I just really don't get it.  I really, really don't.

Chesley's in NY visiting her sister.  I am very tempted to get rid of a cat or two while she's gone.

Have you caught any of this SPAIN: ON THE ROAD AGAIN thing?  If not, you should try to watch a few episodes then explain to me and Chesley why it's so strange and addictive.

I'm working harder right now than I ever have in my life.  12-14 hour days every day.  Feels good still, though I can see that it will begin to wear before too long.  My business web site is seeing a lot of direct traffic in southern california, so if you have anything to do with that, thanks.

I posted a new collage at IAMLEARNINGPHOTOSHOP.blogspot.com.  I had you in mind as it came together.  Lots of L.A. area visits to the blog, too.  By "lots" I mean about 8.  Which seems like a lot for something so dumb!

Chesley and I have completely eschewed just about everything Christmas without planning to do so.  It's just not on our radar screen.  Don't get me wrong, I still recognize its significance as a religious holiday (although a secondary one), but all the bullshit that surrounds it seems very distant now, which is nice.

She's feeling more hopeful now, but Chesley was in the hospital for a couple of nights this week thanks to the demon depression.  Long story, but no matter how it's told it's sad.  She got fired from her job yesterday.  There goes the health insurance and such.  It's very hard.  She has such deep despair and so seldom goes near it and who can blame her?  But it's always in there, hollowing her out.  And then there's the unpredictable rage, and the horrible things she says to me, about me, the things she says which really can't be taken back but which she surely wishes she never said.  Things I wish I had the luxury of believing she hadn't ever thought.  Of course, I love her and believe in her.  If only that was enough for her, but it's not.  At the end of the day she neither loves  nor believes-in herself.  I wish it weren't so. I believe it can change.  But the cliches are completely true.  Whether or not she deals with her despair is up to her and not me.

She's feeling more hopeful now, but Chesley was in the hospital for a couple of nights this week thanks to the demon depression.  Long story, but no matter how it's told it's sad.  She got fired from her job yesterday.  There goes the health insurance and such.  It's very hard.  She has such deep despair and so seldom goes near it and who can blame her?  But it's always in there, hollowing her out.  And then there's the unpredictable rage, and the horrible things she says to me, about me, the things she says which really can't be taken back but which she surely wishes she never said.  Things I wish I had the luxury of believing she hadn't ever thought.  Of course, I love her and believe in her.  If only that was enough for her, but it's not.  At the end of the day she neither loves  nor believes-in herself.  I wish it weren't so. I believe it can change.  But the cliches are completely true.  Whether or not she deals with her despair is up to her and not me.</br></br>

I am still single with a crush on a hot smart bartender musician novelist.

I am still literally penniless.

<b> Jan 3, 2009, at 10:07 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Ugh. In that case, the David Lee Roth sounds probably won't help much.

Actually, it really did help.  We hadn't laughed much together in the couple of weeks before that awesomeness was introduced to our household.


Was the firing related to the depression? Man, does that suck. Really really sucks.

Obviously not in any overt way.  But it did have to do with Chesley's difficulties, which are not precisely due to clinical depression.  Whatever her contribution to the situation was though, her supervisors' handling of it was so lousy that I've been advocating suing.  I doubt that will happen--and it wouldn't do all that much for us here in Virginia--but I honestly do think that some good would come of at least the threat of legal action.  At a minimum Henrico County needs to clarify some of its management practices/policies.


I wish I had something smart to say.

Yes, so do I.


I've been seeing and reading so many stories lately that involve couples hurting each other that it makes one wonder if it's worth the hardship -- which I wonder for approximately 4 seconds and then know it is, of course. I don't think there's anything worse than absolute loneliness. Maybe physical torture. But they're related.

I often wonder if I'd be better off either alone or with someone else, especially recently.  The answer is always no.  Absolute loneliness is hell.


Not all that related other than tangentially, I've been reading almost non-stop Frederick Buechner lately. He deals with loneliness and doubt a lot in his wrestling with God. The latest book I read was "The Son of Laughter," which is about Jacob and covers the four generations between Abraham and Joseph. Super readable but deep, and helps me understand those somewhat dry Bible stories in a new way and also helps me to grapple with what it is to slog through God's silence, or even absence, when circumstances seem impossible. So familiar how God makes Jacob these promises and sends him on this journey but then holds back while Jacob's mental image of what the journey would be jumps the rails. Everything takes longer and is harder and goes worse than anyone could imagine but then in the end things come together in unexpected ways to realize the promises. Kind of comforting, or at least perspective-inducing.

That makes me want to read some more of his stuff.  In the end things come together in unexpected ways to realize the promises.  Here's to hoping!</br></br>

<b> Jan 12, 2009, at 4:12 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Alright.

The L.A. Phil was premiering a new work of his. I knew of this for a long time but if it was gonna be, like,  just an organ piece or something then I wasn't gonna pay the exorbitant sums they require. Turns out, though, it was his fourth symphony. He hasn't written a symphony since before he discovered his current famous style. So it's a big deal. But I had missed my chance at the cheap seats. I called and they said there were no affordable tix left for the Saturday night premiere but there were a few for the Sunday matinee. But they couldn't sell them on the phone, only at the actual box office day-of. I hemmed and hawed. Then my friend Eric said he and his g.f Nina were gonna go. So I called again on Sunday morning about 10am, they said there were some cheap seats if I stood in line. Blew off church, drove down to Disney Hall, got in line about 10:45, box office opened at noon. I'm the first guy in line and the ticket clerk says there's no cheap tickets. Even though the lady on the phone told me there were two hours ago. Back and forth. Finally he says sometimes subscribers turn in tickets for credit. So hang out. And lo, a woman does just that. So I get the $42 seat that passes for "cheap." Eric and Nina show up. We go in. I figure cheap means nosebleed seats, but in fact my seat was practically on the stage. I was just behind all the players. But that was awesome, I could watch Esa Pekka Salonen conduct and watch the percussionists do their thing. And before the show they announced it would end up on iTunes, so please be quiet, and also Arvo Part would be signing CDs in the lobby afterward. I'm like: GUH.

So they play the piece, the "Los Angeles" symphony. Wordplay on "angels" being irresistable to him, it is said. It is very quiet, lots of silence in between passages, and I wept  like a baby for the entire 32 minutes. It was unbelievably beautiful.

So then there's an intermission before they play some Brahms piece or something. I can't even stomach the thought of anything after what I'd just heard, so I meet up with Eric and  Nina and say I'm blowing off the second half. But so maybe I'll have to wait in the lobby until Arvo gets set up to sign things. But in the meantime, let's walk around. Maybe he's out on the veranda or somewhere. So we walk all around Disney Hall looking for any scrum of people that might be besieging the guy. No dice. Lots of people getting drinks, smoking outside, etc. We walk around the entire place. So finally I say I'm gonna hang out in the lobby, they can jet off to find coffee or whatever and find me when they get back. And as we arrange this, we stroll into the cafeteria and THERE HE IS. Sitting at a table with like three or four other guys. To Eric, I'm like: "What do I do?" We don't know. But then Arvo himself gets up like he's gonna hit the men's room, then he kinda turns back. So I just hustle over there and as he gets back to his table I just stick my hand out. And I tell him how beautiful the piece was. And he takes my hand in both of his hands, and smiles, and thanks me, and asks what I do -- I don't know where I got the balls to tell him "composer," good God the chutzpah -- and so he asks my name, and I tell him he wouldn't know it, but he asks my name again, and what kind of music, so I tell him opera and songs, and he laughs and says how hard it is to write opera, and so on, and he's super friendly and nice, and he's got these eyes like someone's grandpa or a saint of some kind, and he's holding my hand in both of his. Super sweet man. Just so kind. And we chitchat a little, and I tell him again how beautiful the piece was, and probably my shirt was still wet from tears, and I tell him I've been a fan for so long, and sorry for interrupting. Then Eric says how beautiful the piece was, etc. And I float off.

And only after did Eric make it known to me that the men at the table were videotaping, so it must have been an interview. But they were cool. And only hours later, after replaying the whole thing for about the ninth time in my mind and repeating to myself, "Holy shit, I met Arvo Part, and he held my hand in his hands and he was super nice to me," did it occur to me that any less idiotic sould might have gotten a photo with him. But then I thought, no, it's okay, that would kind of cheapen my memory of it somehow, become the official moment frozen in time, so I'm okay with just the memory.

God what a nice guy. I still can't believe it.</br></br>

It's a fine line. In the case of that song I think the music / sentiment / tenor conveys the emotional oomph without knowing the literal meaning.

Hey! Who the fuck is Dylan to ask a lyricist for an explanation, anyway?? Fucking pot calling the kettle high.

I think about this--I really do--and I get frustrated, which must be some miniscule fraction of your feeling about it.

</b> <br><br> That is probably the most inspired sentiment that Mr. Adams has ever expressed on record.  That is a great song.  No doubt.

I really think that he would have been a seminal songwriter if he'd done all of that in 1972.  As it is, he's one of those bizarre instances of postmodern assimilation.  Only it's like he doesn't even know he's doing it.   It's done for effect, but I'm not sure he knows that.  I once read a piece of criticism of R. Adams that took as its springboard a line he'd written about an engine turning on a dime.  The critic pointed out that it's not engines which turn on a dime, and that stuff like that just rings false.  Have you heard the story about how Elton John had Ryan Adams and Bob Dylan over to dinner, and the first thing Dylan said was, "What the fuck is a winding wheel?"

Anyway, I was surprised that you were listening to that record.  I didn't know you were a fan.  It's an incredible record, really.  I mean, it's great.  But it's also very deeply confounding.</br></br>

Here's the thing.

In my humble (but expert) opinion, any time two available people of the same sexual orientation spend time together, it's a date.  Period.  Feelings develop, it's inevitable.  Obviously the problem is when the feelings are one sided, and there's no way to help that.

BUT!  Every instant that a dude in your position spends with a woman in her position, he's letting her see how awesome he is, and she's letting him show her!

Maybe it's the beer talking, but I think you're still in the game with this "just friends" chick.

<b> Feb 18, 2009, at 6:06 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> no idea what that is.

that's not the microsoft songwriting program thing, is it?</br></br>

<b> Feb 19, 2009, at 12:39 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I like it for organizing all info for one project in one place.  Granted, that can be done with files in OSX the old-fashioned way, but a lot of what I do is purely image-based, and this is an awesome way to organize photos, drawings, and associated text.

Another reason I like it is for its tagging.  The summer before I went to grad school I was teaching myself database programming for MS Access.  I wanted a note-taking program for keeping track of cool ideas I encountered while reading.  I specifically wanted to integrate the ideas with all the bibliographic info associated with the source.  Mostly, programming this thing was a way of managing my anxiety.  But in any case, let's say I was reading Anna Karenina.  Let's say that every 50 pages there was a sentence that blew my socks off.  I'd only enter all the source info once, then use pull-down menus for subsequent entries.  My system was very buggy, but workable.

That's what Evernote does really well, and from almost any source imaginable.  A note can be text that you type in, a screen capture, a web address, a photo, audio, etc.  If you encountered something while reading that you wanted to keep track of, you could shoot a picture of it with your camera and enter it as a note.  Evernote would decode the text, which would then be searchable.  Same for even hand-written stuff.  It has integrated screen capture so you don't have to switch apps to Grab.

So the beauty of it is that sorts through all the random info and helps hold onto the info that one cares about.  My notebooks (I start a new one for each project) are full of images of furniture, sketches, emails from clients, and so on.

Why doesn't Michelle like you?

Well, if it's true that she doesn't it's because she doesn't have very good taste in people.

also she likes really great movies. and we're going to the museum on sunday to stare at van goghs and shit.

also also, the tagging thing would be pretty kickass. i have quibbles with the spotlight function of osx. it's great, but it would be greater if things were taggable somehow.

</b> <br><br> Yeah, that'll definitely show her something.  Not sure what.

So, it's Thursday night, and here at the Booger Household, that means 30 Rock.  We get pretty excited.

I know we've already covered this ground and that there are way better things to talk about, but I really just hate that band so much it's crazy.  I can't quite put my finger on why they get me so riled up.  Usually, when I'm not into something, I just change the channel.  Like, say Jack Johnson.  I mean, that guy's not going to offend anyone, right?

But KOL are different.  Why do I so detest them?  When I hear one of their songs, I can't change the channel, and I can't becalm myself.  Is this what is meant by "I love to hate it?"  I don't think I really do love the experience.  I'm offended by it.  Yes, offended.  I'm actually not very easily offended in general.  Take religious stuff.  People say all kinds of "offensive" stuff about God, Jesus, Christianity, and the like -- all things I care about a lot -- but I'm never so much offended as befuddled, amused, or saddened.  Certainly there's no vulgarity that offends me--I dare you to try me.

Bad music almost never offends me.  It's everywhere.  If I got offended over it, I wouldn't do anything else.

But, like I said, KOL is a different story.  The guy sounds like fucking Bob Seger.  Bob Seger doesn't offend me, but I sure don't like him.

Maybe it's fake earnestness that offends me.  Or fake intensity.  Like the jock figured out at 28 or whatever that he'd get more pussy if he shifted gears into artsy intensity.  So bogus.

Still, I actually feel angry as I write this.  The songs are going through my head, and I'm really mad.  WTF?

Please explain me to myself.</br></br>

You need professional help with this as soon as possible.  In the meantime:

1)  Do you have any friends there in L.A. who have mentioned having great therapists?  If so, get in touch with that friend asap for a referral.  Describe the situation to the therapist and ask for guidance.  Make sure you're clear--if you have to leave a message--that this can't wait.

2) If it falls to you to assess his seriousness, you'll just have to ask him forthrightly what is up.  Don't worry about the confidence of the ex.  You can tell him she called and that you're both worried about him.  Ask point-blank if he is feeling suicidal.  If he says yes, ask him if he just feels that way or if he actually intends to do it.  If it's the latter, get him to a hospital immediately.  If he resists, call 911.  Do not hesitate.  If it's more of an expression of his despair, just be a friend (which you're great at), but also insist that he meet up with a qualified (and hopefully highly recommended) mental health pro.  Follow up will be crucial here.

Most of the time people will tell you what their intentions are.  Also, likelihood of a completed suicide increases significantly with alcohol use, access to firearms, and a history of previous attempts.  If he has tried before, he needs to be in the hospital.  Ditto if he is a substance abuser or has access to a firearm.

I hope this helps.  Let me know how it goes.

You're in a bad spot and this is hard business.

I'm really struck by your sentence:

She can't understand how she could be so special to me and at the same time have conflict over little, day to day things.  She thinks that even minor conflicts mean hatred.

I have that thing in me too, although not to that degree. I'm intellectually aware that people differ and it's not a rejection. Yet in my mind shit like that gets built up and takes on all these layers of meaning. It's paralyzing sometimes.

When I say I'm praying for you both, I mean that.

I wish I had some wisdom, some fix. Maybe all you can do is sit nearby. As you would with a wounded animal. I don't know.

I think, though, that a reaction as intense as hers actually *confirms * that she loves you in a deep place, because, perversely, a person would only react that way towards someone who'd gotten very very close to them.

Not that that helps right now.</br></br>

I don't want this to seem pat or trite, but this is a verse that got me through some years of badness.

"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God; and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."

Not a silver bullet. No promise that you'll get what you ask for. But maybe a small taste of peace.</br></br>

I got a lot done this morning at work then kind of trailed off productivity wise as the day progressed.  Harrison and I went to dinner which was terrific; he's a great friend.  All my friends are pretty great.  That is incredibly good fortune.

I came home around 7:30.  Chesley and Haiku must be out at her mother and grandfather's house again because Tim and Alexa are in town.  So I've just been sitting here letting my feelings wash over me.  It's not pleasant, and in fact it's total agony, but it's necessary.

Since you requested a lady report, a move was made and smooching ensued.

However, it was with a third woman. So yeah. Surprise! Someone I was interested in a couple years ago but she was in a weird place, and now she's not. She's someone I have intense physical chemistry with, but I'm unsure if we have a deeper connection to uncover. We'll see. But I like to smooch girls. Especially at a church party.

</b> <br><br> The physical comedy of Tony Hale!

My take:  When his gifts are well utilized, as in CTRL and AD (as opposed to that series with Andy Richter or in Stranger Than Fiction), he has an interesting fey quality which is not at all common in US comedy. The closest thing I can think of would be Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster in Jeeves & Wooster, or even Bertie's friend Gussie Fink Nottle, as played by Richard Garnett in the earlier episodes.  Sometimes that kind of thing reads as effeminate, and while I'm no expert, I'm guessing that effeminacy doesn't play well with huge audiences here.  Part of why Buster was so successful as a character was that he was like the gimp of the show, you know what I mean?

I'm happy that CTRL is so popular, because its hero is so atypical for male sitcom leads.  I guess one of the networks has lately been trying to fly some series with nerds as heroes, but I watched it, and it was super-lame.  So my question would be: How to let Tony Hale do his weird, fey, nerdy thing in a context where American viewers (and especially male viewers) will relate?

Lastly, I find the flashes of confidence he shows in CTRL to be very appealing and possibly key.  I wonder if that side doesn't provide a bit of balance to the fey side?  Now that I think of it, Tony Hale seems to fit in well with the line of jewish nebbish comics...smart, nerdy, ineffectual.  Only not jewish.  Is there a way to develop a series around a character who is nerdy, fey, and overly-vulnerable but who has some sort of inner Bruce Lee when it's time to kick ass?  You won't like me when I'm angry, and it makes me angry when you say that Klingon isn't a real language.

You know, like an inversion of the strong, silent type whose masculinity turns out to be a mask for his fear.

Have you seen Jeeves & Wooster?  It is so great it's just crazy.</br></br>

There's talk of more. Rob is taking many meetings now. Evidently CTRL has really taken off in an unprecedented way.

What's the word?

Sounds like your meeting with TH was interesting.

I've thought a lot about CTRL and would say I'm an avid fan, in fact.  I do think that 10 episodes is the perfect length.  Not that it couldn't be expanded.  I was thinking that if it were, maybe it could come to light over time that it wasn't really the keyboard...or the tea.  Maybe it's something specific to Stuart.  Sorta like Bewitched or something, but with a dude.  I dunno.  These thoughts are free.

Just like the time there was an episode of the Cosby show based on an anecdote my parents told to Matt Williams (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931285/) at a cocktail party in VA Beach.  Long, dumb story.

So, I know you know where I'm coming from here, but I am just so fucking lonely.  WAY too much time alone.  I work alone all day then come home where I spend the evening alone.  And so on.  Boo hoo.  But still, ouch.  I don't handle down time with much grace.

</b> <br><br> Yes, I need to start getting out WAY WAY WAY more.  I cannot describe the torpor I'm slipping into.  At first, when all the shit hit the fan, I had stuff planned with friends at least 3 or 4 times a week.  Now that has backed way off.  In fact, I have worked completely alone and not seen anyone after work every day since Monday.  It's like fucking solitary confinement.  Must solve this problem ASAP.

W/regard to CTRL, I was thinking more that Stuart had a magic-inducing influence on all kinds of objects beyond the keyboard.  So it's not quite a magic wand.  The keyboard is just the first instance where he became aware of his powers.  He'd start finding new uses for all kinds of things eventually.   Consequently, his power over the world and other people would quickly grow, and CONTROL would no longer refer to the key on the keyboard but to Stuart's exertion of control over himself and his world.  That way it becomes a deep "what if" existential exploration, but also a great source of comedy, especially as he learned to combine different powers and also as he made terrible mistakes.

I'd never seen that commercial.  Reminds me that Schwa once did a cover of that song, complete with falsetto background domo domo domos.  So terrible.  The cover, I mean, not the commercial.

Awesome re. Janelle whether it leads to something more long-term or not.  Fantastic.</br></br>

<b> Aug 15, 2009, at 12:45 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> You know what's really weird? I'm friends with David McFadzean, who is Matt Williams' partner on Home Improvement and in their production company. I'd like to hear that long dumb story at some point.

As for CTRL, so you're saying the keyboard was a kind of placebo for Stuart's power? Or a kind of magic wand or something, that focuses his power? That's pretty interesting.

Tony had this notion - taking things the other way - that if we went forward the keyboard should become like Stuart's "precious," a la Gollum, and we see what it does to him as people battle over it, etc.

I honestly don't know if this thing can be expanded. But I would try, for money.

Do you remember that VW commercial where the guy sings Mr. Roboto? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdLJ7Pox9Y. I did not realize that's Tony.

Have you considered taking salsa dancing lessons? I'm only half joking. I think the reason - aside from money - I haven't gotten my own place is that I'd go nuts. It's good to have people come in and out. I would definitely get out and go to wine tastings or art openings or whatever. It just feels so much better to leave the house. Which, duh. But still.

Not that that solves any problems. The loneliness is still there. I get that.

I've been hanging out with this woman Janelle. My friend Shauna intro'd us via FB because Janelle was moving here from Boston and Shauna thought we'd hit it off. Which we did. Same tastes and she's funny. And cute. But Shauna also warned me in the same breath that Janelle may not be a keeper, as it were, as she's got some complex stuff going on. All of which is true. But we've been hanging out. And making out. And she's been very clear that she's not necessarily deeply emotionally available. So I've been very cautious in that respect. Also we're not on the same spiritual page, though there seems to be room to move. So this may be very temporary, but it's very fun. Nice to have someone to do things with.</br></br>

From his mid twenties until he began his ministry, Jesus was on the Jerusalem town council.   Many decisions had to be made with regard to the allocation of the town's funds for various things, and the council members exercised complete control over the process.  There were many interest groups, like the town's merchants, the Romans, and of course the poor.  In every case that Jesus had the opportunity to choose between his powerful benefactors and the underrepresented and oppressed, he chose the former.

<b> Aug 24, 2009, at 8:11 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Yeah, there's some really gross bits. Not too many but enough. But it's also hysterically funny in parts as well. And the guy who plays Col. Landa, the Nazi Jew hunter, is AMAZING. Hilarious and scary at the same time. Dude should get an Oscar even though it'll never happen.

Suddenly I miss Video Fan. The way I imss record stores. Loved hanging out, talking to people, hearing about cool stuff. Netflix isn't like that. Also I first saw The Onion (paper) at Video Fan. Marie Sirotniak had seen it on a road trip to Wisconsin or somewhere and loved it so much she subscribed. Obviously, this was back in the stone age.

ACT I

Everything from the invitation to be best man through the flight to Vancouver.  I think that the invite scene should be a long, still shot of you sitting at your desk talking on the phone with the guy.  Only your side of the conversation should be audible.

ACT II

Everything that happens in Vancouver.  I'm thinking of After Hours (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088680/plotsummary)

</b> <br><br> Hi Bret,

I am following up on the "Penis Pokey Activity Book” to see if you were planning coverage. If not, it's completely understandable. See the press release below for a refresher.

Best,
[redacted]


FOR EXCERPT, FEATURE, OR MENTION
PUBLICATION DATE: September 1, 2009

Quirk Books presents the follow-up to "Penis Pokey!”
"Penis Pokey Activity Book” by Christopher Behrens
LINK: http://irreference.com/penis-pokey-activity-book/

"Penis Pokey,” which debuted in fall 2006 and sold more than 150,000 copies, features absolutely no nudity, profanities, or sexual material of any kind. With only a suggestive die-cut hole through the center of it, "Penis Pokey” still turned out to be one of the dirtiest books ever published. Until now . . .

The legacy continues with the "Penis Pokey Activity Book” (September 1, 2009; $12.95; ISBN: 978-1-59474-421-1) by Christopher Behrens. Featuring that infamous die-cut hole, all new illustrations, a dry-erase marker, and a host of challenging new activities, it's innuendo a go-go with interactive games like:

*Make the snake dance
*Escape from the sausage factory
*Connect the dots
*Draw your own framed masterpiece
*And many more

With its solid cardboard construction and bright exciting design, the "Penis Pokey Activity Book” is the perfect gift for college students, bachelor (or bachelorette parties) and exhibitionists of consenting ages. Who knew a die-cut hole and a dry-erase marker could be this much fun?! So join the Pen 15 club, and don't worry, the PEN IS included.

CHRISTOPHER BEHRENS' previous book, "Penis Pokey” (Quirk, 2006), was featured in the Village Voice, The Advocate, Time Out NY, and on Boing Boing as well as countless other websites. He lives in California.

Really? Duplicity?  I hated that movie pretty virulently.  Mostly because of the ending.  I like my heist movies to have the typical heist movie ending.

Amazon Valley Chocolate?  Really, you can't find it?  That's so sad.  It's the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had.  It's one of their "Reserve" flavors, and might be segregated out in the freezer at the store.

I had such a peculiar date last night.  Par for the course.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I could have called her mother, but I have no reason to trust the things she says.  She tends to lie, unfortunately.  Also, psych ward disclosure rules are very different from normal hospital privacy safeguards.  The patient provides those whom she'd like to hear from with a code they must use when calling in.  Without the code the hospital will not acknowledge that the patient is even there.

The good news is that I was finally able this morning to reach a mutual friend.  She knew nothing of Chesley's hospitalization but had received a voicemail on Saturday.  Thus I know that however horrible she may be feeling, Chesley is alive, conscious, and in a safe place.</br></br>

What was up with the car?  Dude, I don't even have it in me to go into this.  She called the next day and is completely and utterly lost.  There's just nothing I can do or say.  Mostly I want to protect myself from the erratic insanity.  At the same time, I dread (I really do mean dread) the call telling me she has killed herself.  I have no influence or control.</br></br>

Casey Waits played in Nashville when I saw him.  It's kind of interesting to listen to his recorded playing.  You can hear where it develops, particularly on the out-take record thingy.

You know, the song "Come on up to the House" has what I think of as the perfect drumming for a TW song.  I guess the guy's name is Andrew Borger.  It's insanely restrained and clock-like.  I feel like I can hear Casey Waits striving for that kind of groove.  Also, Johnny Hott plays like that.</br></br>

Other than the fact that you’re working at night, okay I know that much, but what’s the origin of the expression graveyard shift? And then I worked for a while in a graveyard and my boss, Joe Corvello, he explained it to me. What happened in the old days, way, way, way back, hundreds of years ago, people were very nervous about being buried alive, not anymore nervous than we are today it’s just that the technology was not really with it, you could be taking a nap and they’d fucking bury you. So, there was a law that everybody who got buried had to have a string tied around their wrist in the coffin and then they’d run it up through the roof of the coffin and then they’d go up through the dirt and then they’d go over the branch of a tree on which they’d put a bell… and then there’s a guy who sits in the graveyard all night long waiting to hear a bell… that’s the graveyard shift. You’ll like this one too… the bell and the whole apparatus and everything, you know if you find the guy who actually is alive and underground, he’s called a dead ringer. I’m not kidding."</br></br>

I've been hanging out now and again with this woman, Akeba, who is extraordinarily beautiful. My friend Geoff says that's the only reason I hang out with her. I probably do give her a little more weight for that but she is also smart and interesting - but we're not the same tribe at all.

<b> Oct 19, 2009, at 8:32 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> well, she's just way more mainstreamy than me. not a dealbreaker, but it makes it hard to share enthusiasms for music and culture and such. but she used to have some serious paying corporate job that she quit in order to write. and she writes her ass off too, so it's not talk. so i give her points for that.

as for the clooney thing, yeah, this woman bobette buster who's the script consultant on the project has worked with him. i think when she worked for tony scott. but anyway, she's very well connected. i have one roundabout way to clooney but her way is probably pretty direct. the part is pretty much written for a clooney type to garner awards with. big lead dramatic role, he gets to save a young woman - who turns out to be his daughter - and there's a death scene in the end. not to sound so crass about it, but those are the salient facts.

as for CTRL, rob said NBC wants more and they're negotiating with coke for a sponsorship. hopefully with a bigger budget this time. but i haven't heard any details. i know i'd be first in line to be hired but there's no guarantee.

<b> Oct 19, 2009, at 8:47 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> man, you don't even know.

it will likely be months before there's real movement on that. the plan is for the script to be done by mid november, then for bobette to take it to her bigger stronger partners, then to get to clooney. after that, dunno.</br></br>

<b> Oct 20, 2009, at 12:27 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I think it's called "being male."

What's interesting here in L.A. is that I think I manage to get the attention of the occasional hot chick simply because there is such a high density of hot chicks that the relative hotness isn't that hot. If you follow. So an average looking guy like me can be, like, "Yeah, she's hot but whatever." And at some point women realize that won't be enough.

This is a theory I would like to find hard data for, anyway.</br></br>

That's what's so incredible.  I actually just now made it through the whole thing even though it's been around for like a month.  To me, it says something serious about Microsoft.  Which, like, whatever...we all know.  But either A) Microsoft produced this in a purely sincere way and failed or B) they produced this in an attempt to be humorously ironic and failed.  Either way, the message is clear: Microsoft is super-ultra lame.

I don't care much about Microsoft's merit or lack of it as an issue, really.  But I guess I do find this kind of folly amusing.</br></br>

A small amount of back-and-forth and then we met for coffee.  Ran into each other at same coffee shop a second time.  Went on proper date last night.  Bowling.  We bowled the second game with our left hands.  My score was the same either way: Low.

She is extremely bright and has a great, wry sense of humor.  She's finishing up her undergrad late, having been through some heavy stuff in her early 20s.  Seems to have a healthy dose of self awareness.  Answered affirmatively to the question, "Do you like being alive?"  This is a key issue for me, as impertinent as it may be to ask.  Big Tom Waits fan, owns "Jeeves & Wooster" series on DVD.

I'm very, very hot for her, BUT have intimated that given my situation, going very slowly is all that makes sense.  She was down with that.

<b> Nov 23, 2009, at 2:32 AM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I was just gonna msg you. Not for any particular reason but I was wondering if you'd ever listened to any Berio? I have this album, "Voci," that's awesome. May or may not be your speed.

Also I am reading this kickass biography of Tom Waits called "Low Side of the Road." So so so great. Turns out the man lived like mere blocks from me in Silver Lake. It's hilarious - the photo of his Silver Lake apartment when he was like 23 is EXACTLY what you'd expect from today's average hipster. I'm not kidding. A poster of James Dean on the wall. And Bob Dylan. And stacks of books and records, an ashtray, and the man in a white v-neck t-shirt and a vest, longish hair, a newsboy cap. It's like nothing's changed in 35 years. That shit was taken in 1973 (!).

One thing that HAS changed, however, is the biz. Dramatically. Radically. No one could do what he did in this day. It's statistically impossible. Essentially he did the opposite of what everyone else was doing and copped a lot of signifiers of an era 20 years older than him. Which is commonplace now. So commonplace it's unremarkable and also kinda compulsory, almost. And he got his break by playing fucking open mic nights at the Troubadour. That would be 100% impossible now. But the scene was so small then, and so few records released per year, and so little rock history written, that such things could happen as David Geffen hearing Waits sing while in line for the bathroom and then offering him a contract on the spot.

Fuck. Me.

Tomorrow I'm gonna drive by his old apartment and scope it out. Yes, I am that guy.</br></br>

I was surprised how much conversation could center around the Tv. It's delivery had been botched so it wasn't there. If that was something you were waiting for, how long do you figure you could talk about it?

Mike Hearst has spoken with him on the phone a couple of times.  TW called him after reading an article Mike had written for some quirky musical instrument journal.  Mike was not a fan.  Probably is now, but whatever.  It stung me at the time.

</b> <br><br> Did his hatred of Laurel Canyon country rock extend to Neil Young?

Oddly, TW could have ended up a bit like BS in terms of vocal delivery had he not busted loose with Swordfishtrombones.

Speaking of which, I want to read that book.  I mean, I like some pre-swordfish stuff okay, like Heart Attack & Vine, but not to the same extent as the swordfish and beyond stuff.  It's such a striking departure there, you know?  What happened?

I once heard that Swordfishtrombones sent Elvis Costello into a genuine depression.  Don't know if it's true, but the thing I heard was that he was like, "Why bother after this?"

Speaking of EC, his record Spike is basically the same band as on Frank's Wild Years.  The guy who did the arrangements is the guy who played vibes and whatnot when I saw TW in Nashville.  Anyway, that record thanks "Tom and Kathleen" in the credits which makes it almost like naked homage.

Great vignette in the TW book about Bob Seger noticing TW walking the street, pulling over to give him a ride, driving for 15 mins and then asking where to drop him off. TW: back where you picked me up, Bob, I wasn't done walking yet.</br></br>

<b> Dec 1, 2009, at 9:43 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I don't think he was being mean. I think it just illustrates the basic difference in those two. I think TW meant it, although you can never tell. TW is quick with the rejoinders. The book also mentioned that BS was wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, TW in dark suit etc. Also said they didn't have that much to talk about. I gather they knew each other from the music world. It's well established that TW basically hated all that 70s Laurel Canyon country rock, which I guess maybe Seger was sort of like. Which is funny since Asylum / Electra was mostly about The Eagles and Jackson Browne and all that shit.</br></br>

<b> Dec 8, 2009, at 2:23 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I suspect coffee shops were a different beast back in Tom's day.

You know what's funny? I often go to this coffee shop called Intelligentsia where they make each cup to order and it's kind of ridiculously great (and pricey) coffee. It's always busy and packed with hipsters. And I will frequenly see some 20-something wearing the most hipstery hipster look hunched over a Bible and a notebook scribbling furiously. Every time it turns out they go to this church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. that is both uber-hip in its collective fashion sense and really conservative in its theology. It's the weirdest mix of influences.

So the answer is YES: you do meet nice girls in coffee shops.

But that wasn't what you were hoping for, it turns out.</br></br>

Which, it never does, for me. But still.

I love the combo of: person with cool but unglamorous job + secret life as artist. Seems like a very centered way to live. Alas, in Los Angeles the closest analog is: waitress + who auditions a lot.

I would pay cash money to be in love.

I was deeply stupidly in like with this woman Julie Belle - and there are many reasons why it probably wouldn't work - but she just has the most amazing mind. And she's very pretty too, but I love hearing what's in her brain. I finally had to just confess to my crush in order to exorcise it. I may have mentioned this. She handled it with incredible deftness.

I will do what I can to get the snow to you.  It might come in the form of rain at some later date, but you'll know it when you see it.

Her name is Carrie.  Cuts hair at Pine Street Barber.  Makes art out of glass.  Plays guitar and sings.  Beautiful.  Funny.  Independent.  Warm.  Sane.  Takes care of herself well.  Too early to know what the downsides are.  Would like to proceed cautiously, but that's more difficult than it sounds.</br></br>

is the snow awesome?</br></br>

<b> Dec 19, 2009, at 2:30 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Excellent on both counts.

So, if you would kindly transfer the snow to my neighborhood, we will accept it happily. We would prefer it in its pristine newly-fallen form, if you can manage that.

And: tell me more about the lady.

Also: this a.m. I found this in my nitratehymnal.net inbox, which makes my day:
"I am not of your generation or genre.  I have never even heard of you.  I mostly listen to avant classical & ragas.  But this CD, which came to me by accident, has given me more pleasure than anything else I have heard recently.  This is not "pop music"; this is masterful.  I wish I had the libretto.  Thanks for the great music.

No sweat re Twilight. It's just goofiness.

What's going on there?

Script going out this week to Very Big Names. My feeling would best be described as hopeful but neutral. Obviously, one swings for the homerun but I'd be okay with getting on base. Especially if there's money soon.</br></br>

<b> Jan 26, 2010, at 8:54 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Google him and "Le Poisson Rouge" and you'll get the full cross section of Today's Hot Young Composers. Poisson Rouge is a bar where they do avant music. For real! My posse: rock / classical kids. And it's popular.

He's done arrangements for Antony & the Johnsons, Bjork, people like that.

I will scope out this Mother Tongue piece.

I'm not allowed to name names yet but basically just pick the biggest male actors in the biz and you're close. Insanity.

Not sure when I'll know something. Contractually, the producer has to notify me whenever she sends it to someone, so I'll know that much. I'm sure I'll hear about reactions once she hears. But I have no way to predict. The option is for a year, so this could go on for a long time.

</b> <br><br> So I'm reading this book about how the brain deals with and responds to music.

Turns out that neurons in the auditory cortex fire at the exact same frequency as sounds that hit the ear.  So if you're hearing A=440, these neurons are firing at 440 hz, too.  This is measurable by putting electrodes on the cells in question.  This is the only one-to-one correspondence of its kind in the brain.  Imagine if electrodes on the visual cortex turned red when you saw red, and you get a sense of how spooky this is.

Anyway, some dude decided to see if owls had this same feature in their brains.  He played a melody for the owls and monitored their audio cortices with electrodes.  He then fed the signal from the electrodes into an amp, and voila!  The melody was duplicated.

This may be the single weirdest fact about the brain that I've ever encountered.

<b> Feb 10, 2010, at 1:34 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Man, that's weird.

I don't think I know him. But I know of Mutaytor. Tribe - the church folk in the picture - meets in a warehouse practice space that Mutaytor uses. The common thread is this woman Crunchy who leases the space and manages Mutaytor (and also heads CD production for Warner Bros).

Mutaytor is maybe like a West Coast version of Gwar. Without the phallic fixation. Theatrical, many members, lots of percussion, kind of more a party band for Burning Man people.

The Burning Man thing is so not my aesthetic, but I've come to have a certain affection for it since it turns out to be almost totally free of pretension. Which is the opposite of what I once thought. It's kind of like engineers and science nerds who like to dress up and go play with pyrotechnics in the desert. Which is actually pretty nifty, in a certain light.

It's hard to begrudge a bunch of dorks who are having fun.</br></br>

Leonard PierceA few years ago, I purchased—from a retail store at full price—a CD edition of Styx’s Kilroy Was Here. I did this because I had formulated the belief that, unlike a lot of other stuff I listened to in 1983, it was actually a very good album that had been underestimated by critics for many years.
Boy, was I wrong about that.</br></br>

I don't have much understanding of actual clinical depression. Is it strictly chemical in nature? Or is it triggered by circumstantial stuff? Is there any pattern?

<b> Mar 22, 2010, at 1:47 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> In Arlington I had a friend who used to be a drug dealer who specialized in ecstasy (the drug) and when I told him I'd always been curious about it he told me that actually he didn't recommend it because it depleted one's stores of serotonin. He said you should do it once and then don't do it again because it will never be as good from then on. I thought it was a pretty interesting thing for that guy to say but it also made me realize that I, as a melancholic personality, should not fuck with the serotonin in any way whatsoever.

I think that's some vague stab at sympathizing in a tiny way.

I'm not one to push stuff like acupuncture or non-western medicine in general, but I've heard of some pretty crazy positive outcomes from skeptics who got treated that way. You're probably way ahead of me here but it might be worth looking into. I mean, who knows.

I also recommend comedy.</br></br>

But I'm doing a crash catchup on TV because I signed with this manager whose company has a deal with Fox TV, so I need to write a TV spec (probably gonna write a Breaking Bad script, or maybe a Mad Men) to show people. Man, there justt aren't enough hours in the day for TV though. I don't know how all my TV writer friends keep up.

Is there an opposite condition to depression in which people go into uncontrollable states of euphoria and productivity?

Because I want that.

But it does significantly improve my chances at getting paying work. The guy is really gung-ho and works for a company that has a lot of name actors and also a deal with Fox TV. And he's also gonna try to get me meetings with agents.

Simultaneously, the new script is getting read at studios and big companies and the producer, Bobette, is also pimping me to agents. So all positive developments. But no actual cash.</br></br>

He has definitely gotten more interesting over time. I think the most telling proof of that for me is that in his pre-Island years I love the ballads but mostly can't abide the jazzbo stuff, with a few exceptions. But then when he hits Swordfishtrombones I pretty much like everything. Which remains true through at least Bone Machine. The Anti- records are more spotty but some real gems there, and he keeps pushing his sound forward, for better or worse. Plus, not many people get to work with Robert Wilson. Especially not many people who've been covered by Bob Seger and shit.

I went and looked at a loft space the other day right where he lived with Kathleen and where they shot the "In the Neighborhood" video. Right around Temple Ave and Union St, south of Echo Park. I was kind of stupid how much I enjoyed knowing that.

I was also gonna send you this Arvo Part DVD but I haven't watched it yet and it won't let me copy it. So as soon as I watch that I'll pass it along, if you're interested. (I checked to see if the same company had a Steve Reich vid, but no dice.)</br></br>

I still haven't bought the rest of Glitter and Doom, but it may be the best thing since Bone Machine.  There's lots to like on Anti-, but that Glitter and Doom is just freakin' fierce.

It's weird to think about how this guy who means more to me than any other celebrity type had an entire career that I don't really care about.

That makes me think that there must be different indie royalty on the east vs. the west coast.  The Vivian Girls are the newly anointed over here.  Darlings of Pitchfork and all the rest of those sniveling jerks.  And the thing is, they are truly one of the worst bands ever to get so much attention.

I remember reading a review of a local band here in Richmond in the early 90's.  Here's the review, which I memorized:

"Listening to Hassan Chop is like chewing on tin foil."

It was true (despite the fact that they were such nice people), and it's true of The Vivian Girls.

Here's what I had to say, and what I hope they air:

"I had heard that Linda McCartney once fronted a Jesus and Mary Chain cover band, but I didn't know they were called The Vivian Girls."

There are all these things I see when I look at the screenplay in front of me that I couldn't even explain to you -- grave errors of format and convention, like a monkey pounded on a keyboard. It's stuff only screenwriters would see but it screams "SHORT BUS!" It's stuff that actually has the effect of making me angry.

You know what it's like? When a high level musician looks at a score and someone uses four tied sixteenth notes instead of a quarter note. That kind of thing. Even if it's in some way technically decipherable, it's impossible to play from because the spaces are all wrong on the page. (This screenplay is actually wrong, mostly, though.)</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I had a hideous nightmare last night in which I could neither move nor communicate.  My basic consciousness was also messed up really bad; nothing made sense.  The weird thing that happened while I was in this state was I imagined a piece of music for symphony orchestra that completely kicked ass.  It was bombastic as hell, great big dissonant chords overlapping one another and percussion parts that could take your head off.  It was pretty elaborately arranged and was totally complete.  As awful as I felt in the dream--really, I thought I might be in hell--this piece of music was so fully realized and crystal clear that it was almost worth the suffering.

Here's why I think this is interesting: What does it mean that a human brain can invent something like that while sleeping?  This was a complete work of art...which I apparently "composed" while unconscious.  If I knew how to notate music, and if I could remember it now just a bit more, I'm confident it would stand up next to anything.  Weird.</br></br>

Rainman. Wow, that's just what you needed in your life.</br></br>

<b> Apr 21, 2010, at 8:42 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Well, no Clooney, Pitt or Eastwood. So now the producer is gonna try to get money attached from this company in Tennessee. Then go back to Clooney and/or Kevin Costner.

I know, it sounds insane.

And sometime soon the manager will get involved and may have strategies.</br></br>

<b> Apr 21, 2010, at 9:24 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I don't think there's a perfect analog for the music industry, or at least the part of it we worked in. Maybe if you were a commercial songwriter trying to get Tim McGraw or someone to buy your song.

The manager (sorry, thought I told you about this) is named Jeremy Platt. He was with another company when I met him but now works for a management company called Generate that reps a lot of comics (Patton Oswalt, Janeane Garofalo, et al.) and has a deal with Fox TV. Weirdly, his biggest client is Rob Zombie (who now directs horror films). But he also has the animator Don Hertzfeldt and a bunch of other horror and/or British writers. But he wants to do some projects he actually likes (i.e. not horror). He's a really good guy. When I was arranging my first meeting with him I was like "What do you look like?" and he says "I'll be the Jew with the beard." I decided he was awesome right then. Then he rolled out of the office building in jeans and a t-shirt (in West Hollywood, which is uber pretentious) so I was on his team pretty quickly.

Basically, a manager's job is to shepherd the career of his clients. Whereas an agent mostly sets up specific deals. So he and I will map out various strategies to get work or realize projects. And he'll work with other people I work with, like Bobette, who developed and optioned my SKYLARK script (the one making its way around now). After SKYLARK, the next priority for him is to get me TV work -- since his company has TV connections, not so much because I'm dying to do TV. And that's easier money than movies. And also it might allow him to be a producer on those projects (which is legally off-limits to agents). He takes 10% of whatever gigs I get. (Agents take 15% and lawyers take 5%. I have a lawyer too.) Then the next next project is the romantic comedy script I'm finishing right now as we speak / type.

I am hopeful about all of this. But hope doesn't pay the rent. And I've been burned by industry types before, in music. I think I had three booking agents at various times, all of whom totally screwed me. So while I'm cautiously optimistic, I will wait to celebrate until this guy -- or anyone -- gets me paid.

That said, representation is a significant step. And it legitimizes me in the eyes of others. And it could really turn out well if he does the things he says he can do.</br></br>

Me, PJ, and his bride went to Fredricksgurg to see GRB play a few years ago. On the way home, PJ, who is one of the sweetest people Ive ever met, did something minor to piss off Melissa. We were at a convenience store off the highway.  PJ and I were waiting for her out front. She comes roaring out the door screaming at him and wings a bottle of milk at him. Hard.  Not to be a big wise, but it was actually kind of scary.

I take him out for a beer the next day and try my best to point out that if I saw a guy do that to a woman, I'd call the cops. He tells me that stuff like that happens a lot and he's used to it.

So I've got some mixed feelings about being here. I should have known by then that it's no use trying to tell anyone anything.</br></br>

I just traipsed around the wilds of Echo Park for four or five hours. Got totally lost and had to bushwhack my way to a road at one point. It's such a cool neighborhood. Lots of wild green space where you wouldn't know you're in L.A., then all these amazing houses perched on hillsides, then the huge Elysian Park that surrounds Dodger Stadium. And ran into my perpetual crush Julie Belle at the coffee place on the way home.

Other thing about Echo Park: miles and miles of public staircases. At some places the roads get too steep for cars so they just turn into stairs. There are whole "streets" of houses that live off only a staircase.</br></br>

<b> Apr 25, 2010, at 3:55 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> EC has been a regular guest on the first few episodes of Treme, the new show by the guy who did The Wire. Mostly as a foil but it's good to see him on there.

You used to go to UCLA, right? Man I hate that part of town. HATE. All the things you're afraid L.A. would be. But the East Side almost doesn't feel like L.A. Hills and trees and funk and art and such. Why does it seem like the east side of every city in the world is where the artist types live? It's almost like "east side" is synonymous with that.

I must have explained Julie Belle before. She's about 25, divorced (her husband cheated on her), singer-songwriter, dead sexy. Also got an inch or two on me in height. We really connect on the brain level. Dry humor. Whip smart. Reads a lot of Nouwen but likes to smoke American Spirits as an occasional treat. We speak the same language. Maybe too much? We're almost the same person in a lot of ways, which is probably why we're not cut out to be a couple. That and the age / height thing (her issue, not mine). And who knows what other chemical factors. She's 25 but she could be a hundred. I love her in a way that kind of transcends the sexual stuff. Like, she knows that I crush on her so if she ever came around, I would be super stoked, but if she never does, I just love her the way you love someone who is awesome and decent and whom you wish well in every regard. I'm not shy about my crush but I don't push it. It's there if she ever wants to act on it. She probably won't. That's okay. We really like one another.</br></br>

<b> Apr 25, 2010, at 4:30 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Weddings are full of songs like that. Where if you actually listened to the verses and not the semi-ironic choruses you'd be horrified.

Her music is accomplished but I think she's in that zone where she's really trying to find her own unique take on things. She tries new styles on and they don't fit. I think she's maybe a little tainted by all these clueless L.A. musicians who mean well but don't understand what *soul* is about. But she's on the hunt for the Great Song and I have confidence in her sensibilities.

It's hard man. I remember being in that zone. I didn't figure it out til I was 30 and that was an accident.

Here's a dirty story involving tall women:
This white rapper kid Jason knew, who went by the stage name Cex, was actually a funny and smart dude, but he was DIRTAY. He just banged like every woman he got near. And he met my friend Alison, who's tall and hot, and while she was standing there he says to Jason, "You know why I like sex with tall women? You can just go and go and go all night. More room to park the limo."

Which is the crassest thing I've ever heard but also makes me laugh now and again. "Park the limo." Wow.</br></br>

Jamie has this tattoo across his upper lip:  Chief Bloodtip, Bi-Curious Chimpfister

He goes by "Blood Tip" because of all the hymens he ruins.

Wasn't there a gay Mexican assassin in "Traffic?"

I don't know Bobby Donne at all, but it is very interesting to hear about their interactions.

There's an interesting cohort of ambient-and-mathy-music-loving dudes in this town who all seem a bit bloodless somehow.  Nice enough, but oddly like monks.

Coyote's don't give a shit?  Are you talking about the doglike creatures or does Coyote have another meaning?

And lastly, I have discovered the "meaning" of life.  Here it is:

Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about Life's purpose is to be a good sport about</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Living Easter Island Statue sounds about right.  I was talking with Collee this morning when I said he seems like one of those guys who only listens to obscure electronica and Einstürzende Neubauten.  She laughed because she scanned his iTunes last night and found EXACTLY that.  I'm glad to hear he's a nice guy, though.

What did you mean about coyotes not caring?

FIGHT THE SADNESS indeed.  And the Audi drivers.

I should go to this cookout tonight, but I am embarrassed by myself.</br></br>

<b> May 1, 2010, at 2:39 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Just ran into Julie Belle at the coffee shop. Didn't recognize her because she was wearing flip flops instead of her standard black cowboy boots. This literally happened. She was sitting with her back to me across the courtyard and I squinted to try and see if that was her or if it would be an embarrassing gaffe with a stranger, then I saw the flip flops and said to myself: that's not her.

But it was. She was stoked that her disguise worked. Like Clark Kent's glasses.

She has really brutal chronic  insomnia and so has started this regimen of taking five walks a day so she'll be wiped out at night and sleep naturally. Last night was her first success. So she was in a good mood. Except for the neighbor's chihuahua who barked for a solid hour at 3am. I just sent her the lyrics to Frank's Wild Years.</br></br>

<b> May 1, 2010, at 3:20 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Your poem just made me laugh very hard in a public place.

I will have it tattooed on my breast.

Stephen Fry has entered my list of people I'd like to have a drink with before I die.

Julie Belle and I agreed that the boot flop / thong boot / cowboy flop would be a fashion tragedy. One which we expect to see on some local hipster any day now.

You know what's funny? Gay mexican guys. I'm trying to put my finger on why. Maybe because they resemble the tattooed cholos you see around here all the time, except queeny.

It seems like a statistical certainty that Collee would date Bobby eventually. Like physics. Like the valence levels of the two particles would eventually coincide in just that way.

The part of your email starting at "Richmond" and going through "blocks from there" reads like a William Carlos Williams poem. But more absurdist.

Here is something you learn living in Los Angeles: coyotes don't give a shit.</br></br>

<b> May 1, 2010, at 3:49 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> That tattoo implies more than the usual commitment. You can't just change that fucker to "wino forever," you know? You gotta go the whole distance.

Traffic is one of those movies I remember liking and being generally impressed by but damned if I can remember  a thing about it. I think that means it failed. I would watch it again though, particularly if there really was a gay Mexican assassin in it.

I was always intimidated as shit by Bobby Donne because he is a living Easter Island statue. But then I got to know him a bit via Mike Halverson and--of course--he is a total sweetheart. I read this thing from Simone Weil at Mike's wedding and he emailed me to ask if I would send it to him. It was this kinda heady thing about love.

Bobby does seem kind of monk-like, in a way. Very austere. Seems happy to live and work and create within the walls of his preserve. He and Thomas Merton would probably be best friends and talk about Brian Eno together.

Wow, that image really pleases me a great deal.

Your meaning of life loop inspires me to tell you that I bought that DFW book and just started reading it. It's pretty fucking right on.

My mantra: FIGHT THE SADNESS.

Who is this fucking chump who just pulled up to my Echo Park coffee joint in his Audi? Should I go bash in his windshield? Hey, rich motherfucker, DO NOT drive up the real estate prices in this neighborhood because I hope to buy a bungalow here but I'm gonna need a couple more years, bitch.

Two interesting tidbits:

1.  There's a merciless send-up of Rupert Murdoch.  It's a wonder that Hugh Laurie got the House job on Fox.

2.  Remember the dumbass character from Idiocracy?  The guy who sits around watching "Ow, My Balls?"  That character--costume and all--originated in season 4's first episode.</br></br>

She's the director of this free clinic based in an RV. They do rounds at various church parking lots and the like. They dispense pharmaceuticals and treat people.

It was pretty easy hanging with her. We have a lot to talk about. I felt a little bit on my best behavior, but things kinda loosened up in the later part of the day. There's the whole complex dynamic of meeting someone you've talked to on the phone and recalibrating for the physical person next to you. It's all still sinking in.</br></br>

<b> May 16, 2010, at 4:37 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Can't believe I never told you this one. It's not as big a deal as all that. I just went to see this show at a little joint on Sunset called El Cid. It's a restaurant during the day, shows at night. Also, BTW, was built by D.W. Griffith in order for him to have a place to show BIRTH OF A NATION. Weird. But so anyway, Inara George was playing and then this guy whose name escapes me but he was a guitarist for Captain Beefheart and later for Jeff Buckley. I'd heard PJ Harvey was playing bass for him so I thought I'd check it out. So I watched Inara George, and that show was pretty compelling, actually. Basically the same lineup as the B&theB but I thought the songs were less precious or something. Anyway, I'm leaning against the bar with a drink when this tiny woman in a bright yellow cocktail dress rolls up beside me to get a beverage. And I look over at her and your eye is just drawn to this bright yellow dress, which it must be said looked stunning, and I say to her kinda without thinking "That's a hell of a dress," which is SO cheesy but was precisely what I was thinking, and she smiles a little and says thanks and I realize it's Polly Harvey. Who is TINY. Which is so disconcerting because she sounds and seems about 8 feet tall onstage.

So, yes, I am exactly like Nick Cave.</br></br>

<b> May 21, 2010, at 10:30 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Funny, she literally just walked out the door. She's up here for the weekend at a conference and some other event. We went and ate lunch at my favorite veg place (she's veg), then had some truly kickass gelato at this place that does odd but amazing flavors (they do a lot of alcohol flavors, like Guinness Chocolate and such). Then we came back here so she could look up some stuff she needed for this conference. Then we spent a couple hours climbing hills in Griffith Park. Swapped a lot of stories. She's so funny because she's like this... I dunno how to explain... like, reformed pure person. Grew up super conservative and pious but now is way lefty, but her pastor dad and pastor's wife mom had a stormy relationship with affairs and such but refused to divorce even though they probably should, yet she got reluctantly divorced because of the guy, and she doesn't say bad words unless she really wants to, but I cuss like a sailor, yet she doesn't have the typical lefty Christian thing that kinda sweeps the concept of "sin" under the rug, but I don't really know where she stands on the specifics and clearly she doesn't subscribe to the more fundie notions since many of her church friends are gay. I dunno. It's just really interesting. And she's super bubbly but not in an annoying way. I've caught myself trying to analyze why I like her. Because none of the usual checklist factors apply, really. Yet I don't want to succumb to analyzing it. I think that inadvertently she has circumvented one of my usual complicating factors, which is musical taste: because she is almost a blank slate where modern pop music is concerned. It's disarming and refreshing. I read too much into women's choices of cultural signifiers, you know? Like if she liked Dave Matthews Band that would be a dealbreaker. Which is absurd. Yet not. In a way. Blah blah blah. But it never comes into play with her. She just wants to know about everything. She had a very interesting reaction to this mix CD I made her. I thought sure she'd object to the Tom Waits ("Frank's Wild Years") and the AC/DC ("Back In Black") because girls always hate those bands. Not always, but you know what I mean. But she was down. The ones she didn't go for were X and Talk Talk. I think they were too far from what she knows, so I think she has no referents by which to comprehend them. But as I discussed their respective stories she seemed to come around and get more enthusiastic. To be fair, I probably wouldn't have cared for late Talk Talk when I was young, and that's what it's like with her: like talking to a child in the sense that there are no boundaries already drawn. So you probably gotta ease her into stuff like late Talk Talk.

We're hanging out again tomorrow night and Sunday morning.

Any news on your end?</br></br>

<b> May 22, 2010, at 11:43 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I hear you about the cultural signifiers thing.  I remember having a conversation with you when we both lived in DC.  At the time I was dating Laura--who really liked Shawn Colvin--and had convinced myself that differences in taste didn't matter.  You felt otherwise, and I thought you were wrong.  But you weren't wrong.  It's almost like one's taste in art (broadly) is a proxy for one's attentional gaze.  Or something like that.  It's obviously not the only thing that matters, but it does say something about what a person cares about.  I can totally see where a blank slate would be easier to deal with than a crappy slate!

So did I understand correctly that she has herself been divorced?

<b> May 22, 2010, at 2:59 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Yeah. Dated this guy for five years, was married for five. The basic story, as I understand it, is that he abandoned his faith in a pretty spectacular way--like, he suddenly couldn't bear the thought of his future children being exposed to superstition or anything supernatural. This, after going to years of school to do evangelism or be a missionary or something. I'm not explaining it as well as she did. But what I found interesting in her telling was that he formerly was super all about: it's US vs THEM and we must win them over. Then when he embraced disbelief or whatever, it was still US vs THEM but now he was the "rational" guy against the "superstitious" people. Basically, two analogous flavors of fundamentalism.

She felt she could stick it out and make it work as long as he could respect her belief, but he decided he couldn't. And he felt he'd be holding her back in her own sense of calling, or something. She says they're still friends and intend to remain friends.</br></br>

Big Lebowski is my favorite movie of all time.

I am a stoner except that marijuana makes me feel super awful, so I don't use it.

Hey, back to that Atlantic computer virus article.  If there were a way to make it compelling, it'd be awesome.  I watched War Games recently and was reminded how during my formative years, dramas could use the threat of nuclear annihilation as fuel for the dramatic fire.  We don't have anything close at hand like that now.  But if everyone woke up one morning and nothing worked...the home computers...the phones...the banks...the grocery stores...the military networks...well, that'd be pretty astonishing.

I suspect most stoner movies aren't as interested in consciousness. HAROLD AND KUMAR, for example. On the other hand, I bet ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND would be an awesome stoner movie. Or horrible, I'm not sure.</br></br>

Saw that Renee Flemming thing, watched a video EPK on youtube.  I dunno, man.  But I can see why you like that cougar action.

Did you see that movie "Moon?"  Watched that last night.  Kinda interesting, but fell short somehow.

I'm in an intense state of isolation and am getting pretty batty.

Any news with you?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> There's a young lady named Kristi who works at a coffee shop I used to frequent.  One day I saw her making some sketches and asked to have a look.  I really liked what I saw and I ended up buying a piece from her.  Obviously, this was before my big breakdown.  She decided that rather than selling me an existing piece, she'd do something especially for me, like a commission.  I paid for half of it, and when she was done, she invited me to her place to see it.

Now, before going over to her place I was aware that she might be kind of in to me...some kind of vibe she was putting out there.  But I wasn't going to act on it in any way for three reasons.  First, I wanted the transaction to be all about the art; I wouldn't want the art to be seen as a ploy because it really wasn't.  Secondly, she is 15 years younger than me, 22.  Third, I'm not looking to get in to a relationship.

That would have been the end of the story except that she popped up in a dream.  In it, we were just talking.  Not much to it.  Except that since she keeps coming up in my consciousness.  Recently, a couple of friends have suggested that maybe I should go on some dates.  I think they see how bitterly lonely I've been since the breakdown and how much the isolation I'm dealing with is hurting me.  Collee, specifically, has been encouraging me in this way.  I keep saying, "Who would want to have anything to do with me?  By every objective measure, I'm a complete loser."  She doesn't buy that and insists that 1) I'm good company no matter what kind of shape I'm in and 2) Just going on some dates doesn't mean I want to get into some heavy commitment.

So yesterday in the midst of a barren hell of loneliness, I decided, "Fuck it.  A beautiful, artistic woman has expressed interest in me.  I could use any social connections that come my way right now.  I'll ask her out."  And I did.  And she said yes, and tonight we're getting together for a drink.

Only now am I realizing that 22 is awfully young.

How do you react to this?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> maturity is so relative.  for instance, i know of a 35 year old female who lusts after youngish men with the attitude of a 16 year old.  she is immature beyond her years.


Here's a pop quiz you can administer to determine the actual maturity years of the budding artist:


How much money is in your retirement account?

Was a hair crimper involved in your pre-date primping?

What are we doing in the dreams you have about me?  Because in mine, we're just talking.

Why are you yawning?

Have you experienced a barren hell of loneliness?  When?

	Please describe your last barren hell of loneliness in your own words.

What color is your bedroom?  How much baby and/or baby animal symbology is present?

What would you do if suddenly, in your presence, I "challenged infinity to a staring contest?"



Let me know her answers, and I will be happy to tabulate the maturity years of your barely-legal date.  And enjoy the asking- it's the journey that's so enjoyable.

All the best,

Erin</br></br>

</b> <br><br> It's almost enough to make a believer out of me again.

Not that I'm not a believer.  But maybe I'm not.  I really couldn't say.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that we were all characters in some alien's SIMS game.

I sincerely doubt it's self indulgent of anyone who feels desperate enough under any circumstances to pray that prayer.  Even if they're just upset about like a bad pedicure or something.  Despair is despair.

I'm sorry that you find yourself praying that.  I believe in you and expect that things are going to improve for you any second now.  Sincerely.  I wouldn't say that just to be nice.  I'm too much of an asshole to do that.

As for me, I'm so fucking cooked that's it's just unbelievable.  I just can't stand the thought of another 40 years of this.  At this point I can't even say what (if anything) would make a difference.  I no longer have health insurance which means I can't keep seeing my current psychiatrist.  I tried getting services at the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, but turns out I need to be on Medicaid for that.  So I applied for Medicaid today.  You know where I have to go now to get prescriptions?  The fucking Daily Planet.  They take 5 walk-ins per day, so get there way early.   I have truly fallen through the cracks.  Sometimes I have to make myself sleep by taking slightly too much medicine so I don't stay awake and do something worse.  I am like a goddamn despair machine.  If it's not chaotic and strange (which I can kind of handle), it's hellish despair (which I can't).  I'm really tired.  So tired.  The prognosis sucks.  And yet: Do not worry.  As much as I would love to stop living these days, I am NOT going to take any steps to bring that to fruition.  I need to promise that to someone right about now, so I'm promising you.

Fuck.  All you want is a burrito and instead you get to sit there and read the ravings of a genuine lunatic.  

Sorry for all this.  Really.  

And just because I feel so at-the-end doesn't mean I don't care that you're having a hard time, too.  Because I do.  Tell me about it.  Please.</br></br>

<b> Jun 1, 2010, at 5:19 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Oy. Sounds like a challenging day.

I feel like I'm perpetually in the same situation. Although I'd never say never, it's unlikely I'd ask out someone who's 22 unless they'd been through some serious shit or something. That said, I concur: fuck it. Gets you out of your head for a while, so cool. 

In light of her cancellation, I say go ask out like six or seven other 22 year olds. Why? Because FUCK IT.

Also, I sent you that DFW book today. Eager to hear your reactions. (If we're ever in the same room again I may steal it back at that time, but otherwise don't sweat that.) 

I told the roommates I'm moving out. Just put in the shut-off dates for the utilities that are in my name. Total relief. Moving in with my friend Erik Buckham, who got a great place a couple neighborhoods over. He designs movie posters. Did the one for WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE with the monster in the forest trying to hide behind a tree. He's also now doing the art for the Criterion Collection reissue of THE THIN RED LINE. He also has an awesome dog, Captain, who's an Australian cattle dog.</br></br>

I am not classy, Tim. 

I keep praying that exact prayer. That's interesting. It's probably somehow completely self-indulgent of me to even pray that. And yet I don't care.

I think it's funny that God told me to email you to bitch about dinner right then.</br></br>

<b> Jun 2, 2010, at 4:08 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> This is the worst part for me.  The sense of waste.  The total, stupid purposelessness.  I have nothing to look forward to, and it makes me feel like a useless drain of resources.  Since I lost the ability to function in the most essential ways at the beginning of March, I've been in a living hell.  I wish that I could formulate the desire to be productive.  My days are breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening entertainment, and the outrunning of the suicide hellhound.  Theological questions--even the most pressing and essential ones--do not matter to me in any way that I can sense.

Groundhog Day is an apt analogy for the ceaselessness of the slog, but it breaks down when he comes-to after driving the truck into the quarry.  Most suicides don't end like that.

Being seriously mentally ill often makes people (I'm one of them) pathologically withdrawn.  We cordon ourselves off in our insane, small universes of delusions and suffering. The lack of social connections then makes the mental illness even more painful, weird, and isolating.  Jesus.  Even so, we live in the golden age for the psychotically insane compared to any time in our past.  Me and my sister would have been dead just a couple of decades ago.  The scientific advances keep us half alive, I guess.

Today I took the first real step in a long time towards having some kind of life.  I'm volunteering for NAMI's Virginia office.  For two hours a day three days a week, I'll organize binders and print labels and stuff.  It actually felt kind of good, thank god.

Don't know what I want from anyone.  Certainly not pity.  It's almost like I want my friends to share my utter befuddlement at having gotten so completely lost.

One thing I know I'm fortunate to have is the ability to laugh at comedy even when I feel extremely grim.  Speaking of which, check out the Numberwang sketch I posted earlier if you feel like a few minutes of amusement.</br></br>

It's weird that you call it hellish. Because there is something to that. They get at some weird primal shit that I can't put my finger on. Subtly dream- /nightmare-ish.

Stephen Fry must have mellowed out. I always think of him as sweet. It'll be very interesting to get to those guest spots.

Any idea what the name, "That Mitchell and Webb Look," is about? 
I do  know there was a Scottish band called The BMX Bandits. Though probably they're both referring to some third cultural referent that I don't know about.

</b> <br><br> It's really not different.  It's the exact same as almost all the others.

The sad reality is that A) He should have been in the hospital even if he had to be there over the course of 12 or 18 months and B) He shouldn't have been left alone for a few hours given the many signals he was sending and the fact that it was only a few months after the June attempt.  Serious attempters re-attempt at a rate of 80%, usually within months.  Men succeed at higher rates than women.  A clearer case for involuntary commitment would be difficult to make.

These aren't moral judgements of him or anyone involved.  It's just that the circumstances as described in that Rolling Stone interview and in the Afterward of this book are totally boilerplate.  This is the pattern that gets played out so many thousands of times every year.  Talk about preventable death.  Goddamn.

It makes it all the more heartbreaking to me.  It also makes me mad.  The anger has no specific object, though.  It is just a fucking tragedy.

I want him to have made it.  I think I know what the last 10 minutes of his life were probably like; I've lived through the last 9 over and over again, and I know how horrid it is.   I so fucking wish he had handcuffed himself to something.</br></br>

<b> Jun 6, 2010, at 11:34 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I know what you mean about classics. Sometimes they live up to the hype. Sometimes. I have a hard time reverse engineering the freshness. Actually, that's the main issue we had to deal with in this adaptation of G. K. Chesterton's old novel, "The Man Who Was Thursday," from 1909 or something. Had to rework the plot so it wasn't utterly predictable to an audience who'd seen a hundred years of Thursday rip-offs. 

Word with me: I'm about to watch either the final episode of JOHN ADAMS or JCVD. I'm leaning toward the latter.

Spent Sat / most of today with Cassie in San Diego. Covered a lot of ground hashing out our commonalities and differences on faith matters and suchlike. She's really great but also a bit overwhelming. I'm dating Tinkerbell, seriously. I don't feel like I've fully relaxed yet. There's this see-saw effect with my introversion where the more introverted someone is, the more extroverted I become to balance the equation. Or the more extroverted they are, the more introverted I become. I"m gonna let the weekend sink in and see where we are.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Interesting what you said about reworking the plot of a classic to make it have any punch at all.  I was thinking about that last night during The Third Man and wondering how it could be done.  The main thing would be to add some additional twists to the plot...as it was, the entirety of the movie could be anticipated in the first few minutes.  

How was JCVD?  I hadn't heard about that.

Man, I hear you re. the seesaw effect.  I had a really similar dynamic with MM.  If I was even a tad down, she'd overcompensate with ebullience.  The more bubbly she was, the more I'd feel alienated and alone...to which she'd respond by trying even harder to be upbeat.  Anyway, that's just to say that I think I understand what you're talking about.</br></br>

2.  Getting reprimanded by a supervisor who is much dumber than me because s/he didn't understand why I did something the way I did.
3.  Running into acquaintances of any kind.
4.  At a party and someone says, what kind of work do you do?  And you know--fuck it!--I tell 'em.  Silence ensues.

I was looking for some female to female fun,  and for some reason your post sounds much more interesting. I'm married, have a daughter and I'm currently a translator (Sp-Eng); in my past life I was a financial analyst.  This town sometimes gets to me and I start thinking back to my old ways. ITS NOT HEALTHY!! I think the prudent thing is to just drink instead and leave that old fun where it belongs. What I'm wondering is if I can still talk the talk.

Peace,

My testicle is 37 years old, white, and relatively hairless.  It has been described as "adequate" and "not grotesque."   Although I have had a vasectomy, I was told by the doctor that minor trauma to the testicle could reattach the disconnected tubes.  Once it's yours, you could probably just tap it with a hammer if you wanted to make it work right.</br></br>

I've come to terms with my mortality and I'm enjoying my time, trying to make the most of it. I'm in love with a friend of mine. I love him. I have no idea if his feelings for me are at all romantic. I've felt some sparks but it might totally be one sided. Should I bother? I don't want him to just date me because he feels sorry for me. I have yet to tell I to tell him? Any advice?</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Your Piano Skills for My Testicle
</b> <br><br> I would like to trade your piano skills for my testicle.

ABOUT YOUR PIANO SKILLS

When you sit down at the piano, you do so with a complete command of its most majestic possibilities.  For you, it would be possible to tease the melody of die fledermaus with your right hand while harmonizing exclusively with nearly random minor ninth chords in your left.  You're well informed on matters of music theory in general, and keyboard theory in particular. For example, you're up to speed regarding the recent heated arguments concerning lydian chromaticism vs. traditional natural fourths.  You've absorbed the pedaling lessons of disc two/side two of Keith Jarrett's Köln Concert and have instinctively rejected the entire oeuvre of George Winston and his simpering new age banalities.  You're familiar with the entirety of the western keyboard canon on the one hand and the outré explorations of pioneers like Monk, Taylor, and Rhodes on the other.  You are a master.  If the piano is the lion of instruments, you are its tamer.

ABOUT MY TESTICLE

My testicle is 37-years-old, white, and relatively hairless.  It has been described as "adequate" and "not grotesque."   Although I have had a vasectomy, I was told by the doctor that minor trauma to the testicle could reattach the disconnected tubes.  Once it's yours, you could probably just tap it with a hammer if you wanted to make it work right.  In any case, testicle is offered "as is."

THE TRADE

This is a straightforward deal. You give me your piano skills to me and I send you my testicle. You pay shipping.

Serious Inquiries only.</br></br>

<b> Jun 13, 2010, at 1:27 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I once read that Graham Greene couldn't start writing in the morning until he'd stood on his front lawn watching cars go by.  There was a particular series of digits he had to see on a license plate before he'd go inside and get started for the day.

Do you suffer from procrastination?  I hate it.  I do it with everything, right down to personal hygiene.

Like my boss at Ruffin & Payne said, "Procrastination is like masturbation; in the end you're only fucking yourself."

In other news, I've just learned that there's a gang in Richmond called The World War Crew.  It grew out of some west end church youth group.  They go around beating the shit out of drunk people, apparently.  Sounds a bit like the Taliban.

<b> Jun 13, 2010, at 7:58 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I'm not much of a procrastinator, or rather, I know the limits of my ability to dodge. I know when something has to be done and basically how long it'll take me, so I'll take wiggle room if there's some left. But it's tied into the creative process too, I think, something about getting in the right state of mind to produce.

Man, that license plate thing would drive me nuts.

People are always surprised that I don't have a hard time getting started and writing, but desperation is a great motivator. For me.

With music, however, there is ABSOLUTELY a weird procrastination thing. I don't know why. *That's* the one that you hear artists talk about, how they love their art but hate to start it.

That gang thing sucks but isn't surprising. I've been waiting to see who would emerge as America's most recent Taliban. It's coming.  I mean, we used to have the Klan and stuff. I think all human society has that in there somewhere. Even the ostensibly non-religious ones. If anyone thinks there isn't a lefty intelligentsia Taliban that tries to coalesce, well, they haven't read their history.

There are elements in my morning church who could veer that way. Just a few. But I resist the shit out of them. They will not infect my crew. Any whiff I get of fundie bullshit, I fight tooth and nail.</br></br>

<b> Jun 13, 2010, at 10:59 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> If you ever get a chance to see this doc called THE OATH I recommend it highly. About the guy who was Osama bin Laden's driver before he went to Guantanamo Bay. Amazing film. Really brave filmmaker. Fits nicely into this theorem.

I bailed halfway through church tonight. New guy doing music. Couldn't handle the strummy acoustic guitar shit. For the next few days I'm dogsitting for these people who are total RVA type people somehow in L.A. They have this dog named Xango ("chango") who was the most amazing blue eyes and mottled coat.

 / Timothy McCready <timmccready@mac.com> /  Keith Jarrett
</b> <br><br> My periodic Keith Jarrett fascination is resurfacing recently.  Today I came across the hilarity below in his Wikipedia entry.  As my friend Jamie said when I shared this with him, "What a stud!"

Jarrett is notoriously intolerant of audience noise, including coughing and other involuntary sounds, especially during solo improvised performances. He feels that extraneous noise affects his musical inspiration. As a result, cough drops are routinely supplied to Jarrett's audiences in cold weather, and he has even been known to stop playing and lead the crowd in a group cough. This intolerance was made clear during a concert on October 31, 2006, at the restored Salle Pleyel in Paris. After making an impassioned plea to the audience to stop coughing, Jarrett walked out of the concert during the first half, refusing at first to continue, although he did subsequently return to the stage to finish the first half, and also the second. A further solo concert three days later went undisturbed, following an official announcement beforehand urging the audience to minimize extraneous noise. In 2008, during the first half of another Paris concert, Jarrett complained to the audience about the quality of the piano that he had been given, walking off between solos and remonstrating with staff at the venue. Following an extended interval, the piano was replaced. In 2007, in concert in Perugia during the Umbria Jazz Festival, angered by photographers Jarrett implored the audience: "I do not speak Italian, so someone who speaks English can tell all these assholes with cameras to turn them fucking off right now. Right now! No more photographs, including that red light right there. If we see any more lights, I reserve the right (and I think the privilege is yours to hear us), but I reserve the right and Jack and Gary reserve the right to stop playing and leave the goddamn city!" This caused the organizers of the Festival to declare that they will never invite him again.[13]</br></br>

I went to see this movie, also with Jonah Hill, called CYRUS, that was one of the smartest, funniest comedies I've seen in a long time. For that reason it will probably never play Richmond. But it's highly recommended. Did you know that Marissa Tomei is friggin 47??? MY GOD she's hot. Sooooooo hot. Very hot. Real hot.

I didn't go the GHTTG.  The truth is that I am always disappointed with blockbuster movie comedies.  I like my comedy in shorter spurts where some kind of overarching story line is unnecessary.  Maybe that's more-so true for the big ticket comedies.  Smaller comedies that are more wry or absurd are different from the blockbusters which tend to be too broad and are therefore tiring or something.

You are totally right about your music disclaimer.  Definitely.  Sometimes when I'm feeling super exuberant about something my first impulse is to share it immediately.  But one never knows why something has struck oneself, let alone how someone else will hear it.</br></br>

This article addresses the emergence of a decidedly different geo-cultural milieu for jazz, one that, while sometimes physically composed, performed, or distributed in cities, evokes an idyllic America far from the bustle and hum of the metropolis.

<b> Jun 21, 2010, at 8:18 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> There was an interesting video from Elizabeth Gilbert (yes, the Eat, Pray, Love author) on the TED website about the concept of "genius." Basically saying what if it's not so much that one IS a genius as one HAS a genius and some people uncover it while others maybe don't.

I also once read a super cool New Yorker piece about the concept of "physical genius," as exemplified by Yo Yo Ma, among others. Ma talked about how much of his regimen involves imagining his way through a performance, not actually playing the piece. I think the same story involved a basketball player and someone else.

I kind of doubt we all have the same talents in equal amounts. But clearly there was something in, say, Mozart that allowed him to hear/see music more tangibly than the rest of us. But of course the problem is that no one can separate that out from the years of practice his father forced on him.

There probably is some kind of analytical governor that, like, calculates possible outcomes and thus slows us down, or something. An analog might be touch typing. When you don't think about the component letters of each word, but rather think of the word as a whole, you type way faster. Likewise for chord structures, I'm sure.</br></br>

<b> Jun 22, 2010, at 9:34 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I saw that Elizabeth Gilbert video when it was making the rounds and I guess I kind of fell in love with her.  I should watch it again.  I remember it making me feel good for a few minutes.  That sounds sarcastic, but it isn't.

I suspect that the neural basis for many of the underlying components of musical talent will eventually be well understood.  Surely practice has a lot to do with the Mozarts of the world, but I also think they're starting from a different place.  Take perfect pitch as an example.  It usually shows up by the time a child is 3 years old.  It can't be taught or learned.  It's binary: Either on or off.  I've only met one person who had it, and it definitely seemed to confer an incredible advantage upon him in terms of quickly digesting musical ideas.  You could pound out eight random notes on the keyboard simultaneously, and he could easily tell you what each one was.  He also had whatever the audio equivalent of a photographic memory would be.  You'd say, "Play the third chorus of Miles Davis's solo on 'So What,'" and he'd play it on the piano from memory.  It was uncanny.

Musical prodigies and chess masters seem kind of like the same thing to me.

That typing analogy seems pretty apt...the difference between knowing the alphabet vs. knowing whole words and phrases.  I've never thought of typing like that.  Damn I wish I could play the piano as well as I can type.  I'm a fucking badass typist.  I wonder if I could get a lucrative typing contract with one of the major typing labels?  I'm going to work up some kind of demo.

In other (more hideous) news, it's going to be near 100 degrees here all week.  And humid.  I wish I had a natural talent for tolerating oppressive heat.

Hung out with Ricky last night.  He taught me two new slang terms for vagina.  Ham Wallet and Squishmitten.  As in "Squishmitten Pale Ale."</br></br>

I suspect that the neural basis for many of the underlying components of musical talent will eventually be well understood.  Surely practice has a lot to do with the Mozarts of the world, but I also think they're starting from a different place.  Take perfect pitch as an example.  It usually shows up by the time a child is 3 years old.  It can't be taught or learned.  It's binary: Either on or off.  I've only met one person who had it, and it definitely seemed to confer an incredible advantage upon him in terms of quickly digesting musical ideas.  You could pound out eight random notes on the keyboard simultaneously, and he could easily tell you what each one was.  He also had whatever the audio equivalent of a photographic memory would be.  You'd say, "Play the third chorus of Miles Davis's solo on 'So What,'" and he'd play it on the piano from memory.  It was uncanny.

Musical prodigies and chess masters seem kind of like the same thing to me.

That typing analogy seems pretty apt...the difference between knowing the alphabet vs. knowing whole words and phrases.  I've never thought of typing like that.  Damn I wish I could play the piano as well as I can type.  I'm a fucking badass typist.  I wonder if I could get a lucrative typing contract with one of the major typing labels?  I'm going to work up some kind of demo.

In other (more hideous) news, it's going to be near 100 degrees here all week.  And humid.  I wish I had a natural talent for tolerating oppressive heat.

Hung out with Ricky last night.  He taught me two new slang terms for vagina.  Ham Wallet and Squishmitten.  As in "Squishmitten Pale Ale."</br></br>

This is such an opening scene from some British comedy show.

Re Bach etc., I used to be perplexed why people lumped Arvo Pärt in with Glass / Reich / Adams, but then I sat down and figured out "Fratres" to play on guitar and it turned out that his music is just brutally elegant in the same mathy way. It unfolds in a way that's surprising but, in retrospect, inevitable seeming. And very mathematically rigorous. But it's also madenning to try to do it the same way in my own stuff. So it's weird. There's genius at work but also math. Maybe it's also a very very high level of craft, so high that it becomes indistinguishable from intuition. I think I'm now getting glimpses of that effect in my screenwriting, where I've digested so much form that now it's second nature (almost) and it allows me to play around with it in some ways.

I suppose I have that too in some limited aspects of my musical abilities, but not at any Bach kind of level.</br></br>

<b> Jun 22, 2010, at 1:42 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> The other day I was randomly wondering what percentage of all known words are employable as sexual euphemisms. I would guess, completely unscientifically, around a third. I feel that "ham wallet" lends weight to my theory as I've never before heard "wallet" used in a sexual context. Nor "mitten" for that matter.

I'm glad to see that Ricky has resumed his old role seamlessly.

Ricky is apparently ageless.

I think there's something to the music / chess prodigy link. Mainly because there's some mathematical nexus that I think plays into both those disciplines. As DFW put it, a lot of high level math dorks are fiends for music. And I remember the moment when it clicked with me that Bach's progressions are kind of logically (not to say mathematically) predictable, that there's a mathematical rigor to them. Which is part of what makes them elegant.

One of these days I'm gonna actually read Eat, Pray, Love. And then I'm gonna get SO MUCH HAM WALLET.</br></br>

I know where you're coming from re. Bach. That mathematical rigor is what I love about his music, especially the smaller things that I can digest without too much strain, like the Goldberg Variations.  They're like little musical syllogisms.  I get a similar feeling from Keith Jarrett.  It's like his playing is the same thing as his thinking.  It makes me wonder if people on that level play in order to achieve some kind of consonance with what's happening inside their minds.  You know how some art just feels totally right and consonant with yourself?  Maybe people at the outer limits of talent have to create stuff to get that same feeling.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> ISO REALLY AWESOME NEW CULT

I am looking for an awesome new cult to join.  My most recent cult turned out to be run by a bunch of weird men who wore purple dresses but insisted they were neither cross-dressers nor homosexuals, neither of which would have bothered me.  That's in the past, and like I said, I'm now looking for a new cult.

What I want in a cult is pretty straightforward.  I want some kind of overarching philosophical/psycho-spiritual premise (nonsense is fine) to be instilled into my mind, thus making me a "true believer" in the cult's beliefs and practices.  I guess what I'm saying is that I'd like to be brainwashed.  Right now, my brain is unbelievably filthy, but that will hopefully be your problem soon. The bottom line is that I would prefer to believe your cult's tenets (as long as they're not odious) instead of continuing to have to labor over the formation and maintenance of my own opinions and emotions.

One thing I'd like to find in a cult is some kind of awesome uniform.  As it is, you guys always err on the white-guy-in-a-dashiki side of things.  What do cults have against trousers?  So, yeah, the uniform should be a cross between those worn on The Starship Enterprise and the uniforms worn by "special ops" types in the movies.  Night vision goggles would be awesome; probably easy to work into your theology, too.  I don't want to carry a weapon, but a pair of silicone baking mitts could be handy.  No fanny packs.

The cult should only make totally non-specific prognostications about the future.  I don't want to be one of those dudes with a funny haircut at the airport trying to explain why the passing of this-or-that comet didn't precipitate the end of the world.  Don't misunderstand me, though: Making predictions about the future is an essential part of any good cult.  Just A) make the predictions vague and B) lower the stakes a little.  Try this:  When the seventh moon has crossed Cassandra's Grotto, and the wolf and the unicorn bellow as one, the new age will be upon us.  In this new age, happy hour prices at The Bamboo will prevail...FOREVER.  If you screw that up, nobody's really going to call you on it...and it will have come across as both humble and mystical when you initially proclaimed it.  Plus, drinks are pretty cheap at The Bamboo anyways, so it'll be hard to tell what's what.

I've heard that some cults make their members do chores, but the last thing I want to do is work in some kind of hippie collective.  I'd prefer that this new cult have hordes of servants and maybe even liveried footmen.  Once I'm out spreading the vague, but generally positive message of the cult, I want to be freed from workaday tasks like bill paying or flossing my own teeth.

I'd like to stay in my current apartment but with the cult paying my rent.  I'd like the cult to consist of a bunch of really cool people who are available to hang out a lot and who don't really have to work.  I want a personal chef and a lake house (call it a "retreat" if it helps with the taxes) in Vermont.  A cult jester would be awesome, too, for parties and stuff.  I wonder if Stephen Fry is available?

If the cult you want to pitch to me includes any of the following, you will have my ear:  Top-shelf gin, white sandy beaches in the tropics, an expense account, movie theater gift certificates.

On the other hand, don't bother getting in touch if you're into Aleister Crowley (so passé!), ritual sacrifices (or really, sacrifice of any kind!), tonsure, or the Second Amendment.

</b> <br><br> Dude, speaking of exemplary boobs, I was struck anew by Elizabeth George's when I re-watched that video yesterday.

Was your neighbor maybe coming on to you a bit?  Being taken out for lunch is a pretty good wage for cat-sitting.  Especially lunch with a view.

I once heard that the origin of "hot as balls" had to do with stacks of canon balls in the sun on ship's decks.

Anyway, it's hot as fevered ham wallet, yes.</br></br>

<b> Jun 23, 2010, at 7:07 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Main note: I would make this sound as non-ironic as possible. Aware, but totally sincere.

Also, when I hit the part about the uniform I thought this was gradually revealing itself to be about Scientology. So that's an option. Or a sandtrap, depending on how you see it.

ISO REALLY AWESOME NEW CULT

I am looking for an awesome new cult to join.  My most recent cult turned out to be run by a bunch of weird men who wore purple dresses but insisted they were neither cross-dressers nor homosexuals, neither of which would have bothered me.  That's in the past, and like I said, I'm now looking for a new cult.

The bottom line is that I would prefer to believe your cult's tenets (as long as they're not odious) instead of continuing to have to labor over the formation and maintenance of my own opinions and emotions.

The concept of "thus making me a 'true believer'" seems too passive and/or ironic to me. Can you recast it in a more positive light? Maybe about how you want to believe, belief is a positive thing, etc.

I would probably rework "nonsense is fine" to be more neutral. Like, "an airtight, systematic theology not required / necessary."

"Brainwashing is not too strong a term." Or "Unfortunately, 'brainwashing' has accrued negative connotations. But no one hates a car wash, so why not a brain wash? I could really use one. I've accumulated a lot of unpleasant mental grit."


One thing I'd like to find in a cult is some kind of awesome uniform.  As it is, you guys always err on the white-guy-in-a-dashiki side of things.  What do cults have against trousers?  So, yeah, the uniform should be a cross between those worn on The Starship Enterprise and the uniforms worn by "special ops" types in the movies.  Night vision goggles would be awesome; probably easy to work into your theology, too.  I don't want to carry a weapon, but a pair of silicone baking mitts could be handy.  No fanny packs.

This is where I might seriously go for something closer to Scientology.

Re the neighbor's ham wallet: you assume correctly. I think said inquiry would have been particularly interesting in the driveway.

She was totally showing off her (exemplary) boobs today.

I remember once that Jason watched an entire season of 24 in one sitting. I watched like the first three episodes with him, went to bed, then got up in the morning to discover him still watching.

That is quality entertainment, right there. It may not be quality anything else, but sometimes entertainment is plenty.</br></br>

If it were to suddenly disappear, how much do you figure you'd miss that baby grand piano that sits neglected and silent in your formal parlor? If you're like most people who buy pianos in hopes of their little one becoming the next Mozart, you dropped a serious wad of cash on that thing and then found Susie a piano teacher.  Once a week for two years you dutifully took Susie to the strict old bat's musty home where she systematically destroyed the child's innate love of music by making it all seem so formal and dull.  Susie froze at her first recital, and after that, you didn't have the heart to make her carry on.  Since then, the baby grand has languished in that little parlor that nobody visits.  Its lid is closed, and a spider has spun a jagged web between one of the pedals and the underside of the mute soundboard.  It's said that the piano is the lion of instruments, but this lion lies sedated and alone on the floor of its depressing cage, waiting for something good to happen, but knowing that in all likelihood, nothing good ever will.

Pretty sad, right?

Well cheer up, because I'm here to help you and the sad lion out of this miserable predicament.  In the first place, what you need is to reclaim the lion's cage for your own.  There are a thousand better ways to make use of that wasted square footage. Wouldn't that parlor be much more useful as almost anything besides a piano mausoleum?

Get rid of that piano!  Not only will you gain a new room in your house, but you'll also be saving the sad old lion.  The lion wants to run and play and hunt and fight and mate, and you can give him all that if only you'll let go, if only you will set him free.

And this is where I come in.  I am in the square-footage-reclaiming, lion-freeing business.  I do this work out of a selfless sense of duty and altruism.  It's all very simple: When you're ready to free the lion, simply give me the baby grand.  I know a couple of piano movers who will quote you a very fair rate for the moving expense.  Just say the word.

Dude, what's wrong with this Erik fella?  Dogs are definitely completely awesome in their own right, but come one!  They're also there to attract chicks.  It's just a fact of nature or something.  You gotta borrow this dog A LOT.  When pretty girls are all like, "Awwwww, what's his name?" you can be like, "We call him Squishmitten." Chicks will eat that shit up!

Yeah, piano.  I would hope to grow very obsessive about it and practice the way I used to practice guitar.  I want to follow somebody else's instructional program.  Really pick up some of the basics I skipped along the way before.  I'm talking weekly lessons. In jazz you end up knowing a lot about harmonic theory, you know chord substitutions, turnarounds, and so on.  Not many straight up triads.  You know the key signatures that stuff is in for horns.  But I sure didn't learn to read worth a damn.  I'd like to be decent at that.  I'd like to play piano at least as well as I can type.  And over time, I'd like to be able to follow scores for the composed music that I like.

One thing's for sure: I have too much time on my hands.  Who could believe such a calamity?

I'm going to a cookout in a few hours.  Some new friends.  Should be okay.</br></br>

No big plans. Me and the roommates (Erik and Captain) walked to a coffee shop and read the paper and talked about talking to girls. Actually, Erik could work it pretty hard if he wanted since every pretty girl around comes up to pet Captain. He doesn't capitalize. Fool. I'm shameless about petting women's dogs. They almost all have boyfriends, when you dig, but you know what they say about monkeys and typewriters and Hamlet.

My misfit church posse, Tribe, decided to do a BBQ instead of the usual service so I'll probably head over to that later.

Still got some NYT to read. I'm really stoked about this new movie, INCEPTION. Looks so awesome.</br></br>

Attach one [a B3] to a Leslie Speaker, and you got the greatest electronic sound before there was electronic sound. It was certainly better than whatever the musique concrete guys were farting around with. Dumbasses.</br></br>

<b> Jul 13, 2010, at 11:22 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> He and my grandmother were very decent to me during the weirdo phase of my adolescence. My parents were not so much. I think they knew I was taking a fair bit of shit at home and they had the good sense to just let me be however I was gonna be. I spent every other weekend with them for a long time. He was kind of a hero that way.

He fought in the Pacific during WW2. When his ships made landfall they'd get a ration of two beers. He always gave them away, never drank.

He grew up on amateur radio and did radio and radar stuff during the war. Back when it was so new and secret that his C.O. called "rad - ar." Then worked for Texas Instruments and various electronics companies after the war.

I learned as an adult about his flaws -- his temper (never once directed at me, but my sister saw it some) and a certain irrational streak. All the men in my family have that. I have made an effort not to indulge it. But he was a model that I admired growing up. I talk to him on the phone every month or so. We're not exactly super tight but we're bound pretty tightly, if that makes sense.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Met with prospective piano teacher today.  Raises many, many questions.

Very interesting.  Probably 65 or 70 years old.  Crummy apartment complex off Gaskins.  Ancient Steinway B.  Dress that looks like an old sack.  Dirty glasses.  Strong Spanish accent. Place smells like smoke and old lady.  Extremely serious; no nonsense.  All about technique.  Teaches the Russian method which emphasizes technique from the get go.  Kind of has a "wax on, wax off" feel to the beginning exercises.  Way more like a martial art than music.  Super fine-grained attention to what's happening inside the fingers, wrist, arms, shoulders.

Because my goal is to start from scratch, part of me thinks this will likely be an excellent way to do it.  She obviously knows WTF she's talking about.

At the same time, she has zero interest in new music.  She's all about the established repertoire.  Maybe I shouldn't care about that.

What would you do if you were going to try to start over with music?  The idea is inherently problematic...like trying to start over with English or something.

Please respond to all of this only if it's a welcome break from the intensity you're dealing with.</br></br>

Bang Marathon @ MASS MoCA!
Disparate strands from the contemporary classical, jazz, electronica, world music and indie rock spheres were neatly woven together into a crazy-quilt representation of adventuresome notions…. made available for public consumption. – Steve Smith
Dear Friends,
Back in June, Bang on a Can hosted its annual NYC Marathon- the 23rd celebration of quirky, odd, and experimental music performed by players from around the globe.  There was Gamelan.  There was Xenakis.  There was even Rock Band the video game, featuring BOAC tracks. And as The New York Times noted above, it was all there for the public to enjoy. 
But if you missed the NYC Marathon or can’t get enough adventurous music, never fear, because Bang on a Can is doing a Marathon this weekend! On Saturday, July 31 Bang is hosting its 9th annual Marathon at MASS MoCA as the culmination of the Bang on a Can Summer Institute.  Each summer 30-40 international fellows come up to the Berkshires for a 3-week exploration into all that is artistically off the beaten path, and to celebrate this festival Bang is hosting a 6-hour musical extravaganza showcasing an eclectic super-mix of new and unusual music.  The program starts at 3:45 with:
Mark Stewart and the Orchestra Of Original Instruments performing Fanfare, a do-it-yourself ensemble composed of PVC pipes, plumbing hoses, and the people who love them.   Then the Marathon moves indoors to Hunter Center, where the program features an international an assortment of boundary smashing music: 
 4:00pm:             Tan Dun, Snow in June             Chris Cerrone, Requiem for K.V.             Tom Johnson, Narayana's Cows             Traditional music from Uzbekistan, TBA             Annie Gosfield, Flying Sparks and Heavy Machinery                    6.00pm: Arvo Pärt, Fratres I                         Ted Hearne, Katrina Ballads (excerpts)             Oscar Bettison, Breaking and Entering             David Lang, Forced March             Christine Southworth, ZAP!

</b> <br><br> I love stuff like this.  It's nerdy enough just to enjoy it...but can you imagine actually being the one to figure this out?

S.R. uses interesting sirens in some of his stuff.  "The Desert Music" maybe.

On a related note, multiple electric motors running in the same room create strange and wonderful harmonic series.  At times I would just stand in the middle of the shop and listen.  It was like some sort of raga.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Me too.  But a high pitched minor 2nd sounds really menacing.  The idea of an alarm tuned to a major 3rd seems comical.  Like, "Hey everybody, it's a beautiful day...everything is so lovely isn't it...you're about to die!"

That's so cool about the bells rung by actual monks.  You hadn't told me about that.  And I totally know what you mean about hearing harmonies in weird places.  That physics of music class sounds awesome.  The thing I'm always wondering about music is why we like it anyway.  It has to have a neurological basis.

One of my favorite Pärt pieces is "Solfeggio, for chorus" where it's just a major scale repeating in a variety of octaves.  Sometimes I think that all I want out of music is a set of consonant tones overlapping in slightly odd ways.  I listened to "In C" again today and thought, "you know, this is really kind of vapid in a way."  But whatever, it feels good on my brain.  I heard an interview with Tim Page on Fresh Air where he talked about the first time he heard Steve Reich and how it made his brain feel so good.

Chip knows a shit ton about all this stuff.  He has some kind of advanced degree in acoustics and developed some kind of program for Tufts where students learn physics concepts by designing and building their own musical instruments.  He once tried to explain audio compression to me, but I glazed over after the 3rd or 4th wave pattern he sketched.</br></br>

<b> Aug 3, 2010, at 12:35 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Oooh, logic. How draconian.

I wonder what the far right thinks of C.S. Lewis? That dude was all about logic, not this fuzzy sentimental superstition that passes for Christianity in this country.

They probably co-opt his less challenging ideas, just like everything else.

I could see the U.S. crumbling for a number of reasons, actually, but I'd say greed (on the part of the culture makers on the right, who make $$ off fearmongering) feeds entrenched intolerance (as in, an inability to imagine another's perspective, not merely disagreement), which feeds extremists on both sides, who start holy wars and such. Gullibility and ignorance being the fallow ground for the whole thing.

I guess we're kind of saying the same thing.

I ended up talking with that pastor guy, Chris. Whom you'd only know was a pastor if he told you, because he was in shorts and a t-shirt and working on his MacBook. Anyway, turns out he grew up there, but had been away in Cincinnati for ten years. And the reason he came back was to start a church to combat the sort of over-churchedness of the place, that is, the native assumption that one is "Christian" because one lives there. He noticed my t-shirt, which says "Seek Justice," and is from International Justice Mission--who are badass Xian lawyers who rescue girls out of sex trafficking and such. He sussed out that I wasn't from here. Anyway, what he's doing sounds a lot like the churches I know in L.A., that are aimed at people who basically are sick of all the churchy bullshit and pat answers and easy assumptions, etc etc.

I wished him Godspeed, as that woman exemplifies his biggest obstacle.

And she then proceeded to go on a 20 minute riff with me too. I want to try to be charitable, I'm sure she meant well. But it was just shy of a screed, and some of it was mildly offensive. I get this sense that some people have to convince you of their POV in order to remain convinced themselves. Any hole in the dike equals disaster.</br></br>

<b> Aug 5, 2010, at 7:28 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Most of the hot chicks here seem to be either blonde modelly fake boob types (west side) or gratingly hipster-ish trendoids (east side). I feel like everyone's got some scam working here and it's less about genuine intellectual engagement--which would seem to be more the New York flavor. And also I think smaller cities like RVA or Chapel Hill somehow diffuse a lot of the annoying shit. Maybe they're just more laid-back.

Also, honestly, the average hotness quotient here is several notches higher than anywhere else. So one's instrumentation gets recalibrated.

Right now I'm sitting in the house of some rich guy, a writer for "Dexter" who also apparently does thriller novels. Clyde Phillips. Sweet place. Not ostentatious, just tasteful and nicely appointed. Lots of good furniture--is it "mission style" that is sort of blocky, darker woods, that kind of thing? His place is way up in the hills kind of overlooking Burbank. The unspoken goal here, real estate-wise, is to move uphill. Maybe it's that way everywhere. But so you get all these rich people packed in on these windy hilltop roads. My friend Geoff is his writer's assistant, and they're waiting for the cable guy, but Geoff had to go to a meeting, so I'm here drinking a beer and writing. I could get used to this lifestyle.</br></br>

<b> Aug 5, 2010, at 7:56 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Totally fuck underlining.

The writer's assitant does load paper--or wait for the cable guy--but in this case he also pretty much writes the scripts the writer is hired to write. Because the writer can't really write and is 60 and over it anyway.

It's a stepping stone to the full writer gig.</br></br>

Hmm.</br></br>

<b> Aug 10, 2010, at 5:42 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hard to tell. She had a pretty weird day. Been at this corporate job for seven years, took another offer and gave notice, they asked her to clear out her desk by lunchtime. She seemed a little stunned.

She's very pretty, Asian, funny. Looks good in long sexy dresses. Had a fun convo over lunch. Hard to read when we left. Tentatively seems like we'll have drinks? She either wasn't into me or was wrung out from her nutty day. I guess we'll see.</br></br>

Linda Vaughn, the legendary “Miss Hurst Golden Shifter”
*
Linda Vaughn, the lovely, leggy, legend of the auto racing scene from the 60′s through the early 80′s was better known as–Miss Hurst Golden Shifter. She was a trophy queen whose voluptuous looks and charm often stole the show at auto racing events she attended– SCCA, NASCAR, Indy & Formula One, among others.  Linda has been knocked by many for setting Women’s Lib back with her busty displays, but her passion for the sport ran deep and she had a major impact– not just in promoting the sponsors, but also in advancing women’s racing.  Vaughn earned her SCCA competition license at the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving and then got behind the wheel and raced.

<b> Aug 11, 2010, at 11:28 AM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I get this email from this photo blog called The Selvedge Yard. And it's usually historical photos of macho dudes--Bronson, Dean, Nicholson, et al. Or classic rockers. But the photos are always amazing. But this one cracked me up. "The Golden Shifter." Subtle.

"Common Tones in Simple Time" is especially great.</br></br>

<b> Aug 16, 2010, at 7:00 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> All the Charlie Murphy stories (he's Eddie's brother, in case you couldn't tell) are pretty choice. His Rick James stories are amazing.</br></br>

<b> Aug 16, 2010, at 7:15 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I'm very tempted to go see THE EXPENDABLES.

I think I have that Arvo doc. (How many could there be?) I haven't watched that much of it yet, for some odd inner reason.

Had a pretty sweet couple of days. Just landed a rewrite gig that'll be sort of intense but will pay my bills for the next couple months. And maybe get me close to a new computer. Also head from Gary Kurtz, the STAR WARS producer guy, about his gig, which is delayed a little, so I'm still in the running for that. Also had a pretty kickass date with this woman Emily on Saturday night. She's hilarious. This cute potty-mouthed Brit with a (seemingly) big heart. I'm kind of smitten. We're hanging out again tonight.

Also, FYI, an OkCupid date. She pinged me when I was in Alabama and it took us this long to actually get together.

More than makes up for the weird lunch date the other day with the Asian chick I haven't heard from again. Ha.

I've never seen LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE. Though I think it's in my queue.</br></br>

<b> Aug 17, 2010, at 3:46 AM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> What flavor of worst? Like, treacly? Or terrible pop songs?

Since Emily has work til 8 and I had a dinner thing til 9, I was tasked with surprising her, datewise. So we drove to this drive-in movie theater about a half hour away. We missed all the good stuff so we watched SALT. Which, you know, is exactly what you think it'll be and thus just fine. It was fun. She eats like an 8 year old boy. Nachos, pizza, two kinds of candy, and a churro. And Diet Coke.

Her dad used to work for Scotland Yard, which I find just so cool.

She's super excited about everything and really cute. She does AA -- been sober 6 years, I think -- and we even talked about the fact that I go to church. She seemed cool about it. She said she wants to go back to church. I think she grew up Catholic.

I dig her.</br></br>

<b> Aug 17, 2010, at 3:54 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Treacly to an incredible extent.  But not just that.  There's all sorts of stuff wrong with it.  The movie is a bit goofy itself, but it's rendered flat-out terrible by the music.

Dude, I am so happy to hear your news re. Emily.  That sounds so nice.  Sometimes AA people are extremely wise and compassionate.  Fantastic.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Total chick flick.  Hokey magical realism.  I'd recommend skipping it if it weren't for the compelling horror of the music.

This Justin Bieber thing is kinda mind blowing.</br></br>

<b> Aug 17, 2010, at 7:00 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> For some reason my mind says "chick flick" when confronted with that film title. Probably why I never saw it.

Yes, I'm hoping for some wisdom / compassion, and it would be cool if she could be a participant in the faith life somehow. It seems not farfetched. But it's too early to know what's what with her.

Re your comment on that FB vid: i was watching that guy in brown dance, and it looked almost computer-manipulated, or sped up. But then there was the dog walking through the background, so I think that guy just had amazing moves.</br></br>

Honestly I'll probably never use it--and if I need to for some reason, I can use the laptop. That said, when you install it, try turning off your internet connection.

> You're stone-cold broke.  Ex inherits a fortune in your first month of separation.

> You're having a rough time.  Ex calls "to check in on you."  But mostly she's just displaying how well things are going for her at the moment.  There's no way to prove this, but your gut knows.

> A good friend pulls you aside at a party to tell you that "It's no big deal, but your ex and I went out for drinks recently.  Nothing's happening there.  I just didn't want you to hear about it from someone else."

> You see your former mother-in-law at the bank.  You go to comical lengths to avoid her seeing you.

> Ex insists that she really didn't want you to know about something or other, but she went ahead and told the world's biggest gossip.

> Ex hires a bulldog of a lawyer to handle her side of the divorce after agreeing to do it "mutually," then insists that the lawyer is being so aggressive despite her wishes...and that she's powerless to change it.

> You're stone-cold broke.  Ex inherits a fortune in your first month of separation.

> You're having a rough time.  Ex calls "to check in on you."  But mostly she's just displaying how well things are going for her at the moment.  There's no way to prove this, but your gut knows.

> A good friend pulls you aside at a party to tell you that "It's no big deal, but your ex and I went out for drinks recently.  Nothing's happening there.  I just didn't want you to hear about it from someone else."

<b> Aug 24, 2010, at 6:27 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> So I'm writing this pilot to pitch to Fox via my management company. 

BEST EXES
(Half-hour single camera.) A modern-day “Friends.” About a couple who get divorced but swear to remain “best friends" (or "best exes"). And then optimistically live across the courtyard from one another. Also, they'll keep their circle of mutual friends. 

And thus I'm trying to think up little mundane annoyances that occur between divorced people. (Even friendly ones.) Like the mail coming to the wrong house, or having the same favorite local bar, or seeing someone's car in their driveway overnight. Etc.

Please contribute.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I do remember India.  Her suicide hit me very hard, but probably not as hard as it hit you and John Sarvay. 

I had a psychology teacher in high school who said that getting back together with an ex was like eating your own vomit.  He said this to, like, 10th graders.  He was an awesome teller of truths.

It doesn't really work!  It just doesn't work!  Seems like everyone is so fucking pc about "remaining friends," but if two people could honestly manage that, they could probably also manage staying together.  Unless their relationship never really encompassed any real intimacy to begin with which is what I suspect in these cases.  I'm not saying that the only honest response is outright loathing of one's exes, but cordial distance is probably as good as it's going to get. 

Dude, I'm betting on your 27%.  

So how is this based on India?

Also: The "going out for drinks" thing just didn't really bother me.  Mostly, I advised my friend not to get sucked in and not to feel obliged to tell me anything more about what happens.  He's been attracted to her for 20 years.  His marriage has blasted apart--his wife (the notorious gossip, incidentally) had been fucking other dudes.  Once in the house while HE WAS THERE.  So, he's not thinking straight. Still, if he and Chesley become a couple, I guess I won't be seeing much of him for a while.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I think this has to do with a kind of self-deception.  It's a way of not really acknowledging the problems and the pain.  It's almost always done by people who do not know how to handle their anger in a mature way.  Those people have usually been scarred by someone else's anger at a critical period earlier in their lives.  They seem to make anger the one verboten emotion for themselves.  This denial is crippling; the anger will always find its way out.  But they prefer the illusion, I guess.</br></br>

I like the idea that this particular book burning has a $2,000 cost of entry.  You're just really gunna have to hate the fucking Talmud to participate!

I don't understand your story.  Are you saying that Wendy has a perception that you regularly have sex with non-Christians and that's why she's not interested?

Several things are confusing about this.

First: Is the problem that you're having non-marital sex?

OR

Second: Is that cool, but only if you're nailing a Christian lady?

Third: I've always thought you were a pretty "sexually continent" dude.  Does she think you're out there fucking strippers or something?  Who does she think you are?  Ricky?

Fourth: Where'd she get this notion?  Did Ashley try to disabuse her of it?

Lastly, I think you should forward her this email.  That's what the line of question marks is about.</br></br>

<b> Sep 11, 2010, at 1:13 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Whoa nelly. That's a lot of book.

So, like, something that fundie Muslims and fundie Christians can agree on, at last?


Last night at this get together, I ran into my friend Jim and his girlfriend Ashley. Jim's this 40-something comic book writer who now writes screenplays as well. He was married, has three kids who live with their (apparently nuts) mom in Michigan. Ashley is probably 28 or 30, seems like a Jewish New Yorker although she's from here. Both are people I know from church. And Ashley, for some reason, has been hot to hook me up with this woman Wendy, whom we both know. And I'm certain Wendy isn't interested. But it keeps coming up. So last night she brought it up and after a couple glasses of wine told me Wendy said she didn't want to go out with me because I "sleep with non-Christians." <-- Which is hilarious on a couple of levels. But mainly I'm like: Damn, I wish, can you hook that up? Do you know anyone?

But so now this morning I'm trying to think of what I might have said to Wendy that would give me this rep. I mean, I guess technically it's true, although not in the way she evidently thinks it is.

Oh, church...</br></br>

I don't really know which thing Wendy thought, although I did giggle a little at the notion that it all be hunky dory if I were nailing Christian women. You know, we're all forgiven and stuff.

The way it was put it sounded like she thought I was nailing (non-Christian) strippers. But, no, I am no Ricky. For better or worse.

I hung out with Wendy for one weekend at a church retreat about three years ago or more. I had certainly not slept with anyone she would know, and I don't think I'd slept with anyone at all since Mary Motley in DC. So I'm trying to think what I might have said to give her this idea.

Also, my impression was that she had not always been pure as the driven snow.

I dunno.  Mostly it was just funny. A little sad, but mostly funny. I'm pretty sure Ashley will indeed try to disabuse her of this notion. But I probably don't care.

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 2:38 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> My old roommate Bill McClintock used to wake me up in the morning by blaring "Shining Path."  Back then, Sliang Laos really did terrify me and make me super uncomfortable.  That was before I had any kind of religion, but I remember thinking that they seemed EVIL.  Seriously: EVIL.  Satanic.  I figured they participated in casual heroin use and ritual sacrifice.  You're right about the presentation--no leather, no studs or chains, only one dude had long hair.  Plus that Andrew dude "danced" around like a drunk, wounded chimpanzee.  "Male race eraser...genital reaper..."

I never knew any of those guys, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that Andrew dude has a job, a life partner, or the ability to speak intelligibly.  I thought he was like a satanic Bill the Cat or something.  So you're kind of blowing my mind.

Watching those videos now, I've gotta say: That was one killer band.

Now that you mention the Nietzsche thing, I do kind of remember there being murmurings that Sliang Laos had an unclear Nazi fixation of some sort.  Rumors, most likely.  Similar to biting the head off a bat or whatever.

There are several math-metal types in RVA who have never put the needle down for a second.  I've heard some scary shit about that scene.  One of those guys is a well known hard-drug dealer.  Scott Lewis (who doesn't know the guy except by face) thinks that he may have been involved in a murder that happened next door to where Scott was living.  Similarly, Chesley knew some story about the mathy/heroin scene involving someone dying at a party but the party not stopping.  Of course, there's no telling how much she may have misunderstood / distorted / exaggerated that story.

Anyways, I see some of those faces around, and it's just really fucking sad.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 3:44 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Doesn't it kind of seem like certain aspects of music always get attached to the idea of Satan?  Or at least evil?  I'm thinking about Wagner and Black Metal on the one hand, but even earlier stuff, like the way-too-early chromaticism of Gesualdo.  Sturm and drang, I guess.  Heaviness.  Super loud horn sections (or detuned guitars).  The devil's interval.  All that stuff.

There's probably a completely neurologically explanation for this.  If I were the scholar type, this would probably be an interesting enough topic to chase down for a thesis or dissertation.  But I wonder if the association between heavy music and evil might have something to do with the neurology of fear and aggression.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 1:19 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Dude, what can I say? I feel you. It isn't right or fair but I have that going on as well.

Obviously, shit's way skewed on that front in this town. But so maybe that affects this story. But I heard some exec type talk (man, I hope this wasn't in a movie...) about how he wouldn't hire fat guys to run divisions of his company, no matter how qualified they were, because if you can't control your body then why should I think you can control my company?

Which is so dickish and Darwinistic and gross. Yet maybe not entirely unfounded, at some level. And something that drives me a little bit to exercise, if I'm honest about it. Especially because so much of my industry is founded upon perception. And youthfulness, or perception thereof.

And I'm pretty sure some part of my lizard brain checks out women and goes, "If I can stay basically in shape, why can't you?" Which maybe is not entirely unfounded at some level, but does make me an asshole. Or just a male, possibly.</br></br>

Sliang Laos was terrifying.  I confirmed this after that conversation by watching some shit on Youtube.  The stuff of nightmares.  Pretty awesome in the true sense of the word.

That's a very appealing portrait of roller derby.  I can't really say why I  haven't been to the one here.  Maybe it's the kind of high ticket price.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> My old roommate Bill McClintock used to wake me up in the morning by blaring "Shining Path."  Back then, Sliang Laos really did terrify me and make me super uncomfortable.  That was before I had any kind of religion, but I remember thinking that they seemed EVIL.  Seriously: EVIL.  Satanic.  I figured they participated in casual heroin use and ritual sacrifice.  You're right about the presentation--no leather, no studs or chains, only one dude had long hair.  Plus that Andrew dude "danced" around like a drunk, wounded chimpanzee.  "Male race eraser...genital reaper..."

I never knew any of those guys, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that Andrew dude has a job, a life partner, or the ability to speak intelligibly.  I thought he was like a satanic Bill the Cat or something.  So you're kind of blowing my mind.

Watching those videos now, I've gotta say: That was one killer band.

It's weird to think of Hollywood as having that kind of caste system. From the outside, one figures that even the grips are rich.

Now that you mention the Nietzsche thing, I do kind of remember there being murmurings that Sliang Laos had an unclear Nazi fixation of some sort.  Rumors, most likely.  Similar to biting the head off a bat or whatever.

There are several math-metal types in RVA who have never put the needle down for a second.  I've heard some scary shit about that scene.  One of those guys is a well known hard-drug dealer.  Scott Lewis (who doesn't know the guy except by face) thinks that he may have been involved in a murder that happened next door to where Scott was living.  Similarly, Chesley knew some story about the mathy/heroin scene involving someone dying at a party but the party not stopping.  Of course, there's no telling how much she may have misunderstood / distorted / exaggerated that story.

Anyways, I see some of those faces around, and it's just really fucking sad.</br></br>

The menacing (and probably drug-dealing) part I've seen with my own eyes.  A few weeks ago, I saw him enter the kitchen door at Buddy's on Robinson with two tough looking dudes.  They were in there for about 5 minutes.  They came out with their heads down and quickly went in separate directions without a word to each other.  It was very, very sketchy.

Also, he dated my ex-girlfriend Nathena right after I did, and I've heard that went spectacularly badly for her.  It's really sad.

There's probably a completely neurologically explanation for this.  If I were the scholar type, this would probably be an interesting enough topic to chase down for a thesis or dissertation.  But I wonder if the association between heavy music and evil might have something to do with the neurology of fear and aggression.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 4:53 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Do you remember Andrew Ziegler or Heather Patton? He was in Sliang Laos, she worked at The Corner with me. I just ran into them at the coffee place in my neighborhood. Super sweet people. (Which is funny because I always thought Andrew was so intimidating.) They do production stuff in the film biz here. So random.

People I've run into at roller derby:
- A hot but conservative but interesting but raised Jewish but McCain-supporting woman from my old Bible study.
- My friend Nirvana, who goes to Tribe. Despite the name, she's the opposite of a hippie. Chain-smoking, hard-drinking sweetheart badass.
- My friends Julia Ward and Rob Blum. Julia basically produced The Nitrate Hymnal when she worked at Washington Performing Arts Society. Rob is a DJ and connoisseur of outre electro music and also works at the car museum in town.
- My friend Adriana, who draws comic books and works at Disney.
- This girl Jenny whom I kind of know through one of the punk chicks at church. She's like a cartoon mouse. A small redheaded white girl who is perpetually surrounded by a buzzing cloud of Mexican guys, for some reason.
- This British hipster guy who plays in a band that sounds like Oasis.
- Last night at the after party I met a cute blonde lesbian with something tattooed across her chest who got kicked out of the Navy for being gay.
- Also met a guy named "Bacon" who's about 98 lbs and the official mascot of one of the teams.

I think I thought it would be cheesier. Or kitschier or something. I mean, it's all those things but not in a cloying way. The first time I walked into the massive warehouse where they hold it, I was smitten. I think it was about the vibe of these women dolled up for each other and being legitimately badass. But as a guy you were welcome there but it was clearly not for or about YOU. You were a guest. This was run by the women and they did it for themselves and you could buy a beer and watch but you couldn't really be a part of it at the deepest level. And I guess I have a weakness for badass women. Plus the kind of winking sexy thing, that every single woman gets to be a part of. It was sweet, mostly. The opposite of pretentious. (And that's a similar revelation to the one I had about Burning Man people in CA. I always thought it was pretentious but it turns out it's mostly people goofing around and having fun.)</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 5:46 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Grips probably work more steadily and at a higher average rate than most screenwriters. So it's give-and-take. But they'll probably never get the big payoff that selling a hot script can provide. He and Heather just bought a house.

That band was just crazy good. The drummer remains, to my mind, just one of the top five drummers I've ever witnessed in real life. That guy was like the Franz Kline of drums, I shit you not. He could do more with open space and a couple colors than any fucker with rototoms and a splash cymbal.

The long-haired dude was a late addition. I always thought he was a bad idea, although I like him personally. He recorded some Telegraph Melts stuff early on. Mark Smoot. The guy he replaced was another tall angular Teutonic looking guy.

Andrew said that their guitarist with the glasses, Ron Demmick, only recently got into rehab and cleaned up. That's fifteen solid years of substance abuse since I left. And he was a drunk before that. And maybe using heroin, I can't remember. So you're not far off. But I don't think the other guys had that kind of trouble. I did hear tell of Andrew having a real thing about Nietzsche-type stuff though.

Mike Halverson met Iggy Pop once through a friend. He said that onstage he was, like, demonically possessed. Then, the moment he stepped offstage (covered in blood and spit), he shook Mike's hand very politely and said warmly, "Hi, I'm Jim."

So I'm not surprised by the two aspects of Andrew. Or anyone, really. I think that's why lots of folks get onstage in the first place (including me). To be somehow greater than yourself.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 6:08 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I kinda half believe that stuff.

I remember being at the Hole in the Wall the night one of Skillet's buddies shot someone in the parking lot. And I remember a LOT of drug use. And dark shit in general. Who's the dealer guy?

Did I ever tell you about my idea for the next opera I wanted to do? It was pretty flagrantly based off Sliang Laos, or that vibe. But also based on the book "Lords of Chaos." Check that shit out on Amazon.

http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Bloody-Satanic-Underground/dp/0922915946/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1284329723&sr=8-1

<b> Sep 12, 2010, at 7:00 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> My thesis as regards metal is that it's essentially about adolescent boys needing to feel powerful, particularly in the face of the mystery and quicker maturity of girls. I mean, all that's subterranean to the parties involved. The show would be called "PxWxR."

Adolescent boys feel powerless. On a lot of levels. To boys, girls have this mysterious power that is unknowable. Even if you somehow do get to have sex with them. It transcends that. And you can't really control it. I think a lot of that gets sublimated onto mythical elements in old school metal. Maybe you could apply all this to Wagner or whatever too.

So boys congregate in basements and learn loud, tight riffs and yell and hit drums, and it's both cathartic and technical, and then they demonstrate their mastery in front of people--particularly girls. Etc.

But it's binary. And adult life is nuanced. Which is why grown men playing metal -- with its binary, black / white, rage / silence dynamic -- seems kind of immature to a lot of us.

But the show would be about an Andrew type figure who's the head of this Sliang Laos type metal band, and he becomes kind of a cult figure / leader. Not according to his will or plan but because their utterances seem so pure and stark and easy to read into. He sort of reluctantly embraces it. But there's a female figure who's the undoing of all that. And it comes down to that line where one either grows up and embraces the nuance, or sticks to his black / white guns and goes out in a blaze of glory.

Not totally sure about the details. That's schematic. But musically it would be more heavy, though a mix of orchestral and rock not unlike The NH. But probably dissecting riffs a little more, or something.</br></br>

The producer is so apologetic that I almost don't want to tell them the hard news that unless they do the script my way people will actually mock their film. This isn't hubris on my part, either. Mine's not Citizen Kane but it's way better than their Scooby Doo shit.</br></br>

<b> Sep 20, 2010, at 7:26 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Well, this guy's a novice. It's an indie film. He will never set foot in Hollywood.

The producer has at least dipped his toe in the Hollywood waters and he gets it. But he's caught in between. Basically, he needs to man up more, though, because the director is about to sink the ship.

I don't think there really are any idiots working as Hollywood directors. That I know of. They may have very bad taste but they're not stupid. Occasionally you run into someone who thinks James Cameron is stupid. Or Michael Bay. Those guys are, like, near genius level. Kid you not. But they have dubious taste. All that hokey dialogue in AVATAR, yeah, it's bad, but it also connects with a really broad audience. We aesthetes laugh at it--and he probably doesn't know how to do "better" dialogue honestly, and won't let anyone else touch it evidently--but there's a reason those movies make like a billion dollars. Very broad story ideas, nothing too hifalutin.

The structure of TITANIC, for instance, is kind of a marvel, craft-wise.</br></br>

<b> Sep 21, 2010, at 2:51 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I'll check that out.

I just got the snottiest amateurish email from the director's wife. Un. Classy. In which she quotes back to me my unvarnished comments to the producer about what will happen if they pursue their script draft. Info that was privileged.

I was okay with this producer until now. Now that guy is X'ed.</br></br>

I went to this semi-regular Thursday night happy hour with some people I've been getting to be friends with over the past six months or so.  I wasn't really in the hang-out groove after a late night last night and the "I'm not into you" text exchange from this morning, but I went anyway because I figured it beat hanging out alone all day.

Just as I was about to make my move to leave, this woman Giselle arrived with her roommate...Ann...who just happens to be the woman I went out with last night.  Um, kinda awkward!

Disregard legitimacy.

There’s no need for explanation or apology.

The best dogs are most often mutts.

Can the shortcoming be used as an advantage?

Should

Don’t fret over symmetry.

Your heroes need not oppress you.

Change the pattern to suit your pleasure.

Both orthodoxy and purity are usually tedious and dull.

</b> <br><br> It's very heartening to hear that you know where these come from.  Thanks for responding to this.

I'm my own creativity's harshest critic and enemy.  If I listened to all the shit I sling at myself, I'd never make anything at all.

These were somewhat inspired by Eno's Oblique Strategies which you mentioned to me several months ago.  I sometimes refer to a site that generates one at random, but the truth is, they've not helped me much.  Mine really aren't oblique.  There also not strategies for the most part.  These are more like aphorisms or reminders.  I want to find a visually appealing way to display them at my workspace without it being corny; I need to be reminded of this stuff constantly. 

Yeah, symmetry.  Sometimes it's necessary.  Other ties it hamstrings a person.</br></br>

<b> Sep 30, 2010, at 2:33 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Yeah, I totally know where all these come from.

Have you ever heard of Brian Eno's thing called Oblique Strategies? It's kind of similar. It's kind of a Magic 8-Ball for when you're stuck on a project. I downloaded a dashboard widget for my Mac. But I think his are genuinely more oblique than yours.

There's something to be said for craft, for sure. But it's bad to be tyrannized by craft, you know?

Man, "Don't fret over symmetry" kills me.</br></br>

I was thinking he'd play himself, but your suggestions are all really awesome.

Maybe we'd pitch the idea of having him played by different people from one episode to the next without explanation.  That's definitely a winner.

</b> <br><br> Not sure. 

I'm going to assume that the biopsy will show that it is benign despite the doctor's demeanor today. The mass is 1/2" in diameter which will be treatable even if it is malignant. 

Thus the worse case scenario is that she will have to undergo awful treatments. Fatality is not even a part of this discussion. 

Presently I am more worried about her psychiatric stability.</br></br>

<b> Oct 10, 2010, at 3:14 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> MAX is to making stuff what science is to scientific knowledge (I think?  Maybe?).  Seems like a bag of tools that doesn't really "do" anything (as near as I can tell) but provides a nice way to organize methods of manipulating digital info.

From what I've experienced of it so far, I can extrapolate to some interesting stuff.  One thing I've realized is that there's probably a program (or "patcher" as MAX calls it) for every conceivable type of guitar effects pedal ever made.  So you could paste them into a MAX patcher and connect them however you wanted. (I guess that's what this Fennesz dude was doing?) Instead of spending $100 per pedal like in the old days, I guess it would all be a) free and b) way more customizable.

I can also see where MAX could function as an ultra-sophisticated timing device.  As in, "project this image on that wall whenever a connected sensor hears the A two octaves above middle C."  Or, immediately play a note a minor third above that A using a random sampled sound.  Or turn my neighbor's electricity whenever the volume from her apartment exceeds a certain decibel level.

I'm sure there are patchers that make a wiimote into a control device for pitch, volume, brightness, whatever.  Probably iPhones, too.  And so on.

The learning curve is WAY steeper than any other software I've tackled.  But that's not even a fair comparison, since I haven't done any computer programming since BASIC on my Apple IIe.</br></br>

<b> Oct 10, 2010, at 5:41 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Because I don't have a keyboardist or violinist for this show, I'm separating out the individual instrument tracks from the recording (of two songs) and I'll text MP3s to people. Then I'll try to get them all to press PLAY at the same time. Then I'll sing over that.

Whatever the word we're looking for is, it describes a really powerful thing.

I suspect that part of what tames a piece of music like that is its imitation by film composers.  You know, where the music is in a supporting role so you just kind of absorb it...the visuals and plot give you something to hold onto while your brain absorbs the sound.</br></br>

<b> Oct 11, 2010, at 1:05 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> There was this ambitious kinda post-hardcore band called Iceburn (or maybe Iceburn Collective) who did a full note-for-note version of that as a rock band.

</b> <br><br> "The Singularity" is that moment (projected to arrive ~ 30 years hence) when all of the technologies we've been developing over the past century coalesce into a true, sentient artificial intelligence.  Apparently, it's a controversial topic in that many serious scientists find the concept highly probable based on statistical models of AI development over time, while other serious scientists think it's a load of hooey.   One thing most of them agree on is that once the machines have taken over, they're unlikely to have any use for humans and will probably just wipe us all out as fast as possible...unless they need to use us for slave labor (for example, in silicon mining or something).  It's pretty much The Terminator story minus the time travel.

In the movies, this is always portrayed dramatically and with a horror element.  But I think it'd be super funny as a comedy in which the robots, instead of being omniscient and omnipotent, were, like...stoners or something.

The first image would be Ben Franklin getting his kite struck by lightning.  Super fast montage of computer development kind of like how the beginning of Adaptation shows the earth over millennia.  The first AI attack against humans would be shutting down the power grids worldwide or something.</br></br>

Right this minute I'm stretching Slayer's "Raining Blood" 8x into a 14 minute ambient epic. It's not actually as awesome as I'd thought it might be.

But some of the stuff I've stretched and listened to this morning has been amazing. Lots of things become these gorgeous ambient epics when you stretch them out.

Me: chatting a lot with this woman Alison, who lives in Seattle. So your situation seems enviable. But I've known Alison for like eight years and we know everything about each other. My friend Nate tried to hook me up with her ages ago and we had a lot of false starts on that front, but lately we both seem to have found ourselves in a new place. I think she's grown up (she's 30 now) and I've had a lot of expectations / delusions stripped away, and it feels like suddenly we really see each other as we are for the first time. She's coming down end of March. I'm looking into going up there when I get a little dough. Praise Yahweh for tax refunds.

Otherwise, trying to polish this TV pilot. Almost done. And waiting on movement from the SKYLARK script.</br></br>

<b> Mar 3, 2011, at 9:59 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> This stretching app makes me glad to be alive in 2011.

That sounds very promising re. Alison.  Were you and she in DC at the same time? Keep me posted.

Once you're done with the pilot script, what happens next?  On SKYLARK, are you waiting for a reaction from someone in particular?

You asked about the Baltimore laaayydeee.  In general, I neither reach out nor respond to out of town people.  But her profile was just so cool that I couldn't resist.  We started emailing about 10 days ago and have been gmail chatting over the course of this week.  She's smart, funny, interesting, attractive.  It's been great.  Not sure what's next.  I am slightly afraid that my life may be too unsettled for her, but there's no way to really know that just yet.

In other news, the third season of "That Mitchell and Webb Look" is now streaming on Netflix.  The first episode is so fucking funny that I literally could not catch my breath at one point because I was laughing so hard.  I thought I might pass out.  My stomach hurt.  I wept a bit from laughter.</br></br>

BL not appraised of the pre-lithium situation.  It's hard to know how/when to tell someone.  If I blurt it out prematurely, I deny myself the opportunity to describe the mental health issues within the context of a fuller presentation of my strengths.  In any case, it feels way too early for that kind of thing with this particular person.

Alison: 
She and I never lived anywhere at the same time. That's been part of the issue. I met her at my friend Nate's wedding in Seattle circa New Year's 2003 (I think). They were trying to set us up. But she was Y O U N G. Very sweet and outgoing and funny, but all the baggage that comes from being 23. And also from a somewhat tragic family. Basically for the next many years we caromed off each other at right angles. Once she was in DC to visit and we got so far as a kiss, but then she and Nate's wife wigged when I didn't just up and move to Seattle. (Nate's wife has some unrealistic ideas about romance. Comes from a church upbringing.) But she and I have called / emailed consistently over the years. I saw Nate's wife at another wedding around 2007ish and she grilled me about why I wasn't married to Alison etc etc, but it's hard to explain to someone younger what the sandtraps of youth look like to someone who's struggled through them already. Saying "I understand what she's going through right now, I've been there, and I don't want to be the punching bag while she goes through it" makes me sound like a dick. A lot of it, too, was dumb shit this church was feeding her. Lotta barefoot-and-pregnant type stuff. A church she finally woke up to and left. Also, she lived her dream and moved to Paris. And wasn't that into it. Also, she dated a lot of guys and wasn't that into any of them. But at least burned off a lot of the rainbows and unicorns frou frou shit. Then I didn't hear from her for like six months. I bugged her a few times, nothing. Finally I talked with her and she was like, "I just didn't know why you'd want to be friends with me particularly." And I'm like, "Well, because I love you." Which I meant. More in the friendship way, but genuinely. So that restarted our friendship. Then cut to: a couple weeks ago, when we're video Skyping, and she gets on and I'm a little stunned by her beauty, which she's somehow grown into or something, but also we both discovered that the long arc of our 8 years had caused changes in such a way that we kinda finally intersected, person to person, without baggage or illusions or expectations. And were in much the same place, somehow. So yeah. Since that we've been talking / texting / video chatting nonstop. I just booked a flight up there for the end of the month. (Thank you IRS refund.) 

I don't want to put a lot of unwieldy expectations on it, but some are starting to creep in. And they make me happy, right now.

I just queued M&W Season 3. BRING THE PAIN.

<b> Mar 3, 2011, at 6:27 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> If you want, I think I could devise a simple contraption for use with her.

<b> Mar 3, 2011, at 7:05 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I'm sure that's not the only time that's happened in a sitcom.

This thing involves a steep learning curve for me. Sitcom humor is not my first language. I have no idea if this will fly. But I guess we'll see.

Next: await word from the manager. If it's a go, they pitch to Fox, presumably. If Fox passes, they go elsewhere with it.</br></br>

<b> Mar 3, 2011, at 7:20 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I made a formal study of Friends. It helped a lot. There's a surprising amount of structural rigor to those shows.

Don't be surprised if Episode 2 of Best Exes involves taping a line down the middle. I will happily rip off Happy Days wholesale. I don't actually remember that one but it's been a long long long time. That was a good show, though.

I have all the TV pilot scripts from the last couple years. You might be surprised at how basic the humor is in a lot of them. Also, joke writing is an art unto itself, and I'm no master of it. But that's easy stuff to punch up.

I really love the How I Met Your Mother pilot script. So smartly written.</br></br>

<b> Mar 3, 2011, at 7:37 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> In the last pass I gave the moms lines. I'll admit I fully ripped off Lucille Bluth.

I wish you could have been there for an A / B comparison of the CTRL scripts and what actually happened on set. Really, what I provide is a springboard. A good comic actor brings WAY more than what you could possibly write down. I was glad to see a lot of my lines go, actually.</br></br>

<b> Mar 7, 2011, at 1:26 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Yeah, I suspect it's C. But, you know what? I pretty much go to movies to be emotionally manipulated, in a way.

It's been a long while since I've seen it. I guess since it came out. But I was just reading about Paul Haggis because he published that open resignation letter to the Church of Scientology, which caused a ruckus, and then there was a great New Yorker profile about that a few weeks back. That dude got his start writing friggin Scooby Doo episodes and shit like that. I mean, I've used the term "Scooby Doo" as a derogatory adjective. "Man, that ending was so Scooby Doo." So he's come a long way and therefore I'll pay attention.

Man, there is a special chair in hell for L. Ron Hubbard.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yeah, totally.  I want to be emotionally manipulated, too.  But it's like there's some line I don't want to have crossed, which if it is, kind of spoils the illusion or something.  There's one moment in "Crash" when you think a little girl has been shot.  That feeling lasts about half a minute before you realize that the gun was firing blanks.  In a way, that's totally brilliant--the setup for the gun and ammo is so well done.  But the killing a kid aspect just kind of pulled away the curtain and showed me the wizard or whatever.  I want you to manipulate my emotions, but try to do it in such a way that I don't experience that way.  You know what I mean?

In any case, as regards Paul Haggis, yeah: That's one seriously well-crafted story.

Dude.  I read that New Yorker article in one sitting a few weeks ago.  Apart from the amazing stuff it describes, it was just so well done.  I heard the writer on Fresh Air; it's amazing the lengths The New Yorker went to in their effort to do things just right (and no doubt, to avoid getting their asses sued off by that Miscavige freak).  WTF?  I mean, really...WTF?

I wonder what hell will be like for LRH?  Maybe he'll forever be at the base of a volcano (having been dropped there by a rocket-powered DC-8) getting himself nuked with hydrogen bombs.

I've got to say, if all that shit weren't so spiritually appalling, it would be abso-fucking-lutley hilarious.</br></br>

Or just have me add her and I'll fuck with her life.

I feel you on the movie comedy thing. I don't go to a lot of movie comedies. I think that's ultimately why I'm more of a sad-funny writer rather than a haha-funny writer. Without a thread of heart, comedies get stale really fast. 

Actually that's the thing that kinda freaks me out about sitcoms. They're so haha-funny at such a nonstop pace--but only for 22 minutes, of course. Eventually they have to develop heart to survive over the long term, but initially they're kinda shallow. 

Shit is ramping up with Alison, btw. Going to Seattle. I think it's seriously on.</br></br>

<b> Mar 8, 2011, at 8:09 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Heh. That would be some justice if you sent her that.

M&W / F&L are sketch shows so they don't have to do the heart thing. That's probably why they're so perfect.

I can't stand Scrubs, dude. I've tried once or twice. Bleh.

But think about A.D. It's cartoony but they totally work the family subtext. I think a lot of shows just do the heartstrings thing by rote. There's DEFINITELY a formal expectation that the last few minutes of the show get a little gooey. It's part of the formula. 

Have you seen The I.T. Crowd? It's interesting because it's British but soooo American in form. My roommate loves it. I like it okay. It's kind of shallow in that American way. Now my roommate is on to Parks and Rec. Which makes me laugh occasionally but I kinda hate the main character. Same gag, over and over.

Woody Allen is what I'm talking about (kinda, from the comedy side -- I could also write from the drama side and inject humor). People don't make comedies like that anymore because they don't fit in a neat box. (Not true actually: Noah Baumbach et al. make them, and they're indies.) They're not rom-coms. Not really. They're comedies, and they're romantic, but not slavish about form. Very smart. Probably too smart for most. The masses are into escapism. That's not an indictment, btw, just an observation. It's people like us -- overeducated, complicated interior lives, restless -- who like to leaven our escapism with some brain candy.

I'm going to Seattle March 20-24. She's got plans to take us to some island for a couple days. And I'll also catch up with my friend Nate and his fam. But we had "the talk" the other day in which I sorta articulated why it's different now. She cried. Later I tried to make sure I wasn't way off base and she said "It was perfect." She's awesome. Funny, sweet, but a little acerbic too, swears like a sailor, looks adorable, great taste, super lively. This is just a shitty screen grab from Skype, but you can stalk her on FB if you want.

BL: Her end of the chat got real pointed.  Questions about money, debt.  Do I do yoga?  Is my passport current?  Do I meditate?  I think she was trying to see if I measured up to her standards--which is completely fair--but it felt a tad out of synch to me.  Kind of a boner killer.  After that, the contact just kind of tapered off.  One day I may send her an email out of the blue just to say, "You killed my boner."

<b> Mar 16, 2011, at 7:04 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Seattle: Four days.

Pilot: dunno. Awaiting a call from Jeremy the manager about the verdict from the management company's head of TV development. I suspect a rewrite will be required. He liked the second draft a lot more than the first but said it still seemed to jokey and not character-driven enough. That's sort of painful to hear but I suspect he's right. I don't really want to do comic riffage, per se; I want to do character driven stuff. But I thought it was what Fox required. Whatever, I'm learning.

I don't have to have it ready until May, it turns out. So I have time. But I'm simultaneously trying to figure out how to get staffed as a writer on other shows, or to just get an assitant or PA job on some show and work up. It's an utterly byzantine world. Like a lot of things, I'm simultaneously under- and over-qualified to be an assistant. So I dunno.

In other news, I had a good meeting with an up-and-coming director about SKYLARK. He's really hot to do it and his management team is behind it. But we have to wait to hear back from friggin M. McConnaughey and now also Icon, Mel Gibson's company, before he can run with it. It's really hard for me to be patient.

What's the word on your end? BTW, I did write to Tony about the headshot but haven't heard back. I pinged him again today about another thing so maybe he'll get back to me. Will advise.</br></br>

<b> Mar 16, 2011, at 7:30 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> SKYLARK is the one where this aging playboy goes back to the hicksville hometown he fled 20 years ago to attend his mother's funeral. But really he's there to retrieve this classic Skylark locked up in her garage. It was his dad's, and the only thing they could do together without fighting was work on it, but he stole it 20 years ago and drove down to Central America on a wild binge and his dad died while he was gone. Anyway, he's back for the first time since that. He meets this hot latina chick and tries to seduce her, gets her as far as his motel room, when she pulls out a photo of him and the Skylark and a woman who looks just like her. But the datestamp on the photo is 20 years ago. She says it's a picture of her parents. She's there to collect some dough from the will and basically to give him shit. His family rejects her so she steals the Skylark. He and his old flame chase her down and there realize she got into the country from Panama by being a drug mule and thugs are after her. He rescues her in the Skylark and they haul ass across half the country to square things with the drug dealer, while the thugs chase them. Along the way they air out their differences and he tries to impart some self-worth to her as she's a mess. Things go badly with the dealer, and our hero dies (for her), but she comes out of the whole thing strong and knowing she was loved by her dad.

Phew.

What happened with BL?

I think the thing with faith is that even when it seems like there's nothing there, if you don't close yourself off, there's the possibility for God to reassert himself in your life in some way you didn't expect. I guess that's been my experience. But I absolutely understand how your own sensations or whatever could be blanched out. For sure.

I have a real complex relationship with orthodoxy, in any case.</br></br>

Collee has bad teeth.  There's some risk that she might lose all of them before she's 50.  Because she's the kind of friend I can say this kind of thing to, I promised her that if she lost all of her teeth I would immediately marry her.  If you catch my drift.  

So, bad teeth?  How bad are we talking?

<b> Mar 26, 2011, at 7:52 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Watching the Reggie Watts thing now. So good. I love how it starts like a TED talk.

I found Alison's email about him and it said he used to play at her restaurant on Sundays and sleep with one of her coworkers.

Alison is probably a phone convo. BUt the basic deal is it's on in a very serious way. She's moving here in July. I'm thinking about rings.

...oh man, RW just went into full Shakespeare mode. Taking a little hilarity break...

Dude, this is one of those things where all the scales fall from your eyes in tandem. There was always all these roadblocks, of some emotional sort. Not any more. So I went up there, she picked me up, kinda dodged the smooch. And I totally wasn't worried. I just called her a chicken and figured she was nervous. We got coffee and drove up to her mom's north of Seattle to swap cars (hers is junk) and then headed an hour north to the ferry. Out in Skagit Valley we stopped at a roadside produce stand and then finally got our smooch on. She wears this bright red lipstick and we came away with it all over both our faces. It was hilarious. Just like MYSTERY TRAIN. But so then we got some food and got on the ferry to Lopez Island. There we stayed with this older couple (70ish) who are kind of her spiritual parents. Her dad committed suicide when she was a teenager and her mom's remarried to this sorta biker ex hippie dude, both nice but not real solid people. Anyway, Steve and Mary have really been her parents for ages. They rent a farmhouse there. WE had dinner with them (and they kinda quizzed me about myself, etc.) then after they went to bed totally made out on the couch. HOt. Then in the a.m. after breakfast with them we walked around the town then took the ferry over to San Juan Island, which is more resorty and had dinner and drinks at this sweet restaurant overlooking the sound. Oh, I forgot: at the farmhouse this bald eagle got caught in the netting over the chicken run and we helped cut him out with the animal rescue guy. I had to hold down a bald eagle. Who was hellbent on tearing our flesh off. I'll attach pix. BUt so anyway, this whole time we're talking about our deal and noting how it seems so clear and obvious. We're so on the same page about everything. And it seems really easy

(the club riff is amazing.)

anyway, it seems really easy, which I attribute to eight years of friendship in which we told each other everything, so there's no hangups or surprises or skeletons, you know? And we have such similar sensibilities. And she's just so centered, suddenly, which she wasn't always. She grew up. She grew into her own skin. And I've grown and changed too, of course, in ways that aren't as apparent to my own self. And she's a WOMAN, not a girl anymore. We have a lot of the same understandings and experiences with faith and its sandtraps, with disappointments and breakthroughs, etc etc. And but so anyway, we took the ferry back to Steve and Mary's, made out in the car and then on the couch. And in the a.m. Steve announced he and Mary wre going to take the ferry with us and the women were going to ride together in one car and the men in the other. So this was part 2 of the grilling, the man-to-man stuff where he asked about my intentions and so on. Which I actually value about him and his role in her life. I'm glad there's someone to do that for her. Since I have a No Secrets policy, I told him everything he wanted to know. And you know how with most people you date you always internally fight with all these nagging issues and doubts and fears and stuff? Well I had and have none of that with her. I know her well. And it just seems super clear. So I told him, Yeah, I mean to marry her. And we talked about all that. So then we drove back to Seattle and that night had dinner with her best friend Laura and her husband Greg. Laura and Alison are hilarious together, total potty mouths, constantly trying to make the grossest sex joke, etc., which I love. And Greg is this tall tattooed rocker dude who's really sweet and drinks like a fish without ever getting discernably drunk. Kinda weird. They have a 3 yr old son with a mohawk who's hilarious. They're super people. They grilled me a little but in a friendly way. WE had some kickass duck in a reduction of cognac and mushrooms, recipe courtesy of the chef at Alison's restaurant. The next day we went to the park, met her friend Salad for cuban sandwiches. A lot of her friends wanted to check me out. My favorite was her friend I know as Skinny Amber Who Likes To Fuck, aka Snacks. Then we went downtown for the French discussion group she leads. I walked around until she was done and then we went to have dinner with my friend Nate and his wife Rachel. I was in Out_Circuit with Nate. Rachel used to be in Beauty Pill. Alison and Rachel had been on the outs for a while because Rachel is kinda way into the safe Christian bubble and tends to force advice and legalism on Alison in a way that she doesn't realize is condescending. So Alison didn't want Rachel offering her advice about what to do with our relationship. BUt we'd worked out that we were official by then so Alison went and it was great. Kinda blew both their minds, they didn't see it coming. But it was nice and they really seemed to patch up a lot of stuff. And me and Nate just talked music and dude stuff. So then the next morning she took me to the airport and I came home. BUt we covered a tremendous amount of emotional ground. We really established that we love each other. And that we want to do this. And although it's not like anyone else's relationship roadmap, this makes a lot of sense to us. And now we're figuring out how to be together in one city and be a couple.

You should go out tonight to some bar you'd never go to otherwise and pretend you're in a foreign country and basically throw down and have an epic night.</br></br>

<b> Mar 27, 2011, at 4:41 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> All of the above. Although, God BLESS her, she hates the idea of the normal wedding. She wants to hit a justice of the peace along with the immediate family and then do a big party for all the friends later. I could kiss her just for that. Amazing.

We had a big discussion / freakout / resolution about the gameplan the other night / morning. All good now. But upshot: she's moving here in July, we're tying the knot in the fall sometime TBD. I'll likely go up there, pack her up, we'll drive down here. I guess Plan A would be for us to find the place we want to live and for her to move in there in July. Which means I'll have two rents for a while. She'll also need to get a car as Blanche, her junker, won't make it probably. She'll need to find a job. And make friends. And etc etc.

But I'd REALLY like to be debt-free by that time, which is a VERY TALL ORDER indeed. And not possible without either a script sale or a serious writing gig. Also I'd like to take her on a honeymoon somewhere.

The money thing freaks me out if I dwell on it. But, as she so wisely concluded about the move and gameplan, it makes no sense to let fear inform your decisions.

Holy shit she's great. I mean really great. She always was, but of late it's, like, DISTILLED. Refined. Focused. She has her girl moments but she's a total fucking badass.</br></br>

Alissa, the casting director and the woman who hired me, says that unlike other reality shows, with PW potential contestants want to hear from you when you call. So that makes the job easier. A lot of shows, they're suspicious and reluctant. I think a lot of newer shows are more exploitative. I remember watching PW when I lived at the other house because my roommate was really into it. It's not bad at all. I have no investment in the world of fashion, but everyone who gets cast has an amazing backstory and a lot of genuine talent. So it's very easy to get drawn in.

I'm learning WAY more than I ever dreamed about the fashion world. Too bad I have to drive to the ass end of the valley to do it.</br></br>

<b> Apr 5, 2011, at 8:07 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Last night Darren came over for drinks with his new girlfried, Jenny.

I truly love Darren, substance abuse problems and all.

He's hilarious and very empathetic and generous-spirited.

I'm a little worried about him hanging with this lady, though.

She likes to crush up Ritalin and snort it.

I knew that before they came over (Darren had told me about it),

so I took all the meds out of my

medicine cabinet and hid them.

I figured...why even let the temptation exist?

Well, so, she's a massage therapist, Reiki practitioner,

all around total hippie crystals-and-all type.

Shows up with a cigar box FULL of pot.

Like enough pot that if she got stopped by a cop,

she'd definitely get a possession-with-intent-to distribute charge.

That didn't bother me really, but it did seem odd.

Who walks around with $1,000 worth of weed in a box?

Okay, I just get this sense that...

...that she's not trustworthy.

You know I love a loser and all,

but she kinda frightens me or unsettles me.

I get pretty drunk.

She is touching me a lot. Very sensually.

Doing Reiki, she says.

Everyone's pretty lit. She's really high.

All of the sudden, there's this friend of hers, Farhad,

and he seems like a nice enough guy,

but when did he show up in my apartment?

And now she's like stroking my inner thigh and shit.

Darren and Farhad are both in the room,

and I start thinking,

Holy shit:

Is this going where it feels like it could be going?

Because I really DO NOT want it to go there.

By this point I'm really freaked out by her.

Things are winding down.

Thank God she has stopped touching me.

I'm guzzling gatorade.

Farhad seems to have left.

Then it's all over.

I sleep in my clothes.

all around total hippie crystals-and-all type.

Shows up with a cigar box FULL of pot.

Like enough pot that if she got stopped by a cop,

she'd definitely get a possession-with-intent-to distribute charge.

That didn't bother me really, but it did seem odd.

Who walks around with $1,000 worth of weed in a box?

Okay, I just get this sense that...

...that she's not trustworthy.

You know I love a loser and all,

but she kinda frightens me or unsettles me.

I get pretty drunk.

She is touching me a lot. Very sensually.

Doing Reiki, she says.

Everyone's pretty lit. She's really high.

All of the sudden, there's this friend of hers, Farhad,

and he seems like a nice enough guy,

but when did he show up in my apartment?

And now she's like stroking my inner thigh and shit.

Darren and Farhad are both in the room,

and I start thinking,

Holy shit:

Is this going where it feels like it could be going?

Because I really DO NOT want it to go there.

By this point I'm really freaked out by her.

Things are winding down.

Thank God she has stopped touching me.

I'm guzzling gatorade.

Farhad seems to have left.

Then it's all over.

I sleep in my clothes.

It was the sleaziest night of my tame life.</br></br>

It's largely about the discovery that he obsessively read and re-read
the cheesiest self-help books. And not just for research for his
novels.

But I particularly identify with this one note about Alice Miller's
"The Drama of the Gifted Child."

"Miller's gifted child splits into two: one is the grandiose child,
who is a super-achieving, obedient, reliable and "good" child, and the
other a depressed child who never was loved, never was allowed to be a
child, who was forced to perform and excel from such an early age that
he has become irrecoverably lost to himself."</br></br>

I tried watching Steve Coogan's more recent show where he's like a contractor or something and drives a yellow muscle car.  It was 100% lost on me.  I just did not get it at all.  I've not seen much of the Alan Partridge stuff.  Where should I start?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Thanks for the Alan Partidge link.  I look forward to that.

It's hard to imagine that Tony is not Buster, but I know it shouldn't be.  He was a different character in CTRL.

I'm re-watching all of the ABOF&L episodes again.  Moments ago, SF said:

<b> Apr 17, 2011, at 4:45 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Did I tell you about this new HBO show that Tony is gonna be on? it's called "Veep" and it stars Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as the first female vice president. It's a comedy. And it's written by Armando Iannucci, who was one of the genius collaborators behind much of Steve Coogan's great work, as well as the film IN THE LOOP that came out last year. I'm really stoked about it. I tried hard to find a way to get hired by that show. Tony very kindly went to bat for me. No dice, thus far. But I'm glad for him. I think it's gonna be awesome.</br></br>

<b> Apr 17, 2011, at 5:11 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I never saw whatever Coogan show that is. I just posted a recent AP webisode on my FB page. It's pretty okay. But the original show was amazing. Alan Partridge was kind of a precursor to Ricky Gervais' character on The Office--basically a self-deluded prat who believes himself to be far more important than he is. One of my favorite episodes is here: http://www.veoh.com/watch/v6297003rkM6r3qJ?h1=S1-E1+A+Room+With+An+Alan.divx

The backstory is that Alan had a show before this one (which is true in reality) and that he got fired from it and banished to backwater drive-time radio in Norwich. And now he fantasizes about wooing the BBC exec who fired him to get his show back. 

In real life Tony is pretty dry. He can be funny just by habit but he doesn't crack jokes constantly. He's pretty serious in a lot of ways. He's not Buster. He's always a little exhausted. He busts his ass, workwise, and mostly on short-term or smallish gigs. Supporting parts in studio films, leads in indie films, shooting pilots. But he's super nice and personable and looks out for people. He's a pretty regular dude. His wife is a really normal woman from Alabama, named Martel, who speaks with a southern drawl, and they have a really beautiful little girl named Loy. After Myrna Loy, I think.</br></br>

Instead of "droll," we like "hilarious."
And Now for Some Hilarious Observations?
Well, almost.  But not quite.  You see, we're not sure "observations" will go over all that well either.  We're thinking that "observations" might sound a bit hoity toity; it's almost like "observations" is too droll ha ha ha ha.  We're pretty sure that "shizz" would play better in the marketplace. Hear us out, Tim.  "Hilarious Shizz" just totally kills.  People are going to love the hell out of that.  We might even be able to get you on a morning radio show or two.
Quelle joie. Is that all?
Well, no, there is one more thing.  Don't you think that "And Now for Some" is kind of a mouthful?  What if we took that phrase, replaced it with just the word "yo," and then stuck "yo" after the Hilarious Shizz part?  As in "Hilarious Shizz, Yo" by Tim McCready.

<b> Apr 23, 2011, at 7:11 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Is this supposed to be an email exchange? Or a phone exchange? Unless it's a transcription of a phone exchange, I'd lose the ellipses in the first graf. (Assuming you're going for genuine reader ambiguity whether this is real or not.)

Likewise, assuming this is from (fake) email, I'd play up the "ha ha ha" a bit more somehow. You don't want to use "LOL" but if there's something in between?

I like this but the faux-street thing kinda gives away the gag. Just a tad too unlikely. I wonder if you could somehow skew it more toward, like, NPR-speak. Or McSweeney's-speak. Or a parody of whatever humor writer tropes are out there right now (Tina Fey's "Bossypants" comes to mind). I think we can kind of see this coming, as is. But if it were something genuinely absurd that sounds just-plausible-enough-to-be-real, it could slay.

Last thing: I'd fix the last line. The writer knows Tim will hate this. So what if he couched it in terms of what a marketing juggernaut it's gonna be, and isn't that what Tim really wants, etc. Implying "isn't that actually great?" But not actually saying it. 

So I'd say this is 82% right on. But the tone needs work. That's my dos centavos. Very close. Very much in the ballpark.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Check this out.  About to call her in a few minutes.

There's this antiques place in Mechanicsville called Cold Harbor Antiques Mall.  I first went there last summer or fall.  Lots of cool mid-century stuff.  While there I met one of the owners, an attractive woman named Robin who also makes cool metal jewelry.  At the time, I just didn't feel up to asking her out.  For some reason I assumed she was married.

Anyhow, Julie and I were there last Monday and I ran into her again.  The three of us chatted, and I got a really good feeling from her.  Julie said, "Well, she seems very nice...and not at all insane or bitchy" which kind of made it sound like Julie was surprised that I was attracted to Robin.  Julie also said that Robin didn't "seem" married, whatever that means.  Women's intuition I guess.

All week I went back and forth with myself about whether or not to ask her out.  I hemmed and hawed.  Finally, I decided that I'd drive up there and go for it.  So I did just that late Saturday.  We were chatting about the weather, and I said, "To be candid, I didn't come here today to shop."  And then I asked her out.  She enthusiastically accepted!

I called yesterday at 6PM.  Got her voicemail.  Waited by the phone all evening, beginning to feel kind of dejected.  Waited during lunch thinking maybe she'd call then.  I thought something had gone awry.  I was at the pharmacy for like 5 minutes this afternoon--no cell reception there--and when I left, I had a voicemail from her.  She'd been at the Flaming Lips last night.

Anyway, I'm kind of excited about this possibility.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Btw, on Saturday I got extremely drunk and hung out with this new friend Ben and some people he knew, one of whom was an attractive single lady named Allison.  Something about her sent me into a sort of sexual frenzy.

You would not believe the shit I pulled with her.  I can't believe it.   I did absolutely everything I could think of to get her to come home with me, and I'm pretty sure she nearly did.  I said things that were just plainly absurd ("I imagine that men must tell you how beautiful you are all the time," etc.)  While having a conversation with someone to my right, I put my left hand on her right thigh, and left it there.  She did not object, but still: That doesn't make it not ridiculous.  I left a bit earlier than she did, but not before texting an invitation to stop by on her way home.  She didn't stop by.  I was passed out by then anyway.

All morning on Sunday I was perplexed.  I just could not understand what had gotten into me.  I've been drunk around single women from time to time for 20 years, and I've never been quite that much of a Lothario.  It was like I simply had to have sex with her, and that was that.  Anyhow, I decided I'd better call her (Why?  To apologize?  Wouldn't that just make things worse? I don't know.) so I called and left a message.  She texted me a while later saying she'd like to get together some night this week.

And so, I have a problem.  I'm pretty excited about this potential date with Robin.  Do I go out with Allison, too, just to see?  Is there any way to get out of this situation without mistreating her?</br></br>

<b> May 25, 2011, at 6:56 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Well, there was the person I told you about, Robin.  I asked her out at her antiques mall.  Just finished date #2 with her.  Painful!  She's geared at a much, much lower speed.  Conversation on both dates has been like pulling teeth.  After date #1 I thought maybe she was nervous and we should go out again.  Ugh.  Super nice.  It just doesn't compute.

Allison is the woman I hit on like a total lech. That was on a Saturday.  The following Friday I had her over for drinks, snacks, whatnot.  I was still completely hot for her, like extremely droolingly hot for her.  She's like, "I think you're hot, too, but I feel weird about stuff."  I'm like, "You should listen to that, go with it.  Listen to yourself."  When she's leaving, she hugs me.  And BAM! It turns into way more than a hug, and she starts it.  We are naked within 20 seconds.  Oh man, I'd been thinking about this all week...and little else.  We're on the couch.  Now we're in my bed, and BAM!  I can't get a boner.  [SAD TROMBONE]

I have a doctor's appointment about that next week.  Totally psychological.  Happens to dudes after divorce.  Gotta get that shit fixed ASAP.

Anyway, in addition to wanting to have sex with her, I also really like Allison.  Quirky, odd, very smart. Also not the same as me which is a big plus.

Okay.  Monday I had drinks with a woman who got in touch via OKC.  She's a therapist.  The date was like a classic Woody Allen movie, in a good way.  I was all confidence and calm.  She was all neuroses and intelligence.  Helen.  We will see each other again.  A person of substance.  Good conversation.  Quick wit.  Am I physically attracted to her?  I don't know.

Marianne I've not met in person.  We were supposed to meet for drinks tomorrow, but her work caused her to reschedule.  She's a DNC press secretary working on the Obama re-election campaign in Virginia.  Every single part of her OKC profile included an unattributed quote from The Big Lebowski which is a major bonus in my book.  We started emailing outside of OKC which got me her real name which I then googled.  Turns out she was a concert cellist before ditching that to work for the first Obama campaign.  Weird.  Looked at her Twitter feed, and it included Nico Muhly.  Seems like we'll have a lot to talk about.

Robin (antiques mall) is achingly beautiful.  But she's a libertarian, and I just can't talk to her.

Allison is a microbiologist working on a masters in public health.

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Re:
</b> <br><br> Well, there was the person I told you about, Robin.  I asked her out at her antiques mall.  Just finished date #2 with her.  Painful!  She's geared at a much, much lower speed.  Conversation on both dates has been like pulling teeth.  After date #1 I thought maybe she was nervous and we should go out again.  Ugh.  Super nice.  It just doesn't compute.

Allison is the woman I hit on like a total lech. That was on a Saturday.  The following Friday I had her over for drinks, snacks, whatnot.  I was still completely hot for her, like extremely droolingly hot for her.  She's like, "I think you're hot, too, but I feel weird about stuff."  I'm like, "You should listen to that, go with it.  Listen to yourself."  When she's leaving, she hugs me.  And BAM! It turns into way more than a hug, and she starts it.  We are naked within 20 seconds.  Oh man, I'd been thinking about this all week...and little else.  We're on the couch.  Now we're in my bed, and BAM!  I can't get a boner.  [SAD TROMBONE]

I have a doctor's appointment about that next week.  Totally psychological.  Happens to dudes after divorce.  Gotta get that shit fixed ASAP.

Anyway, in addition to wanting to have sex with her, I also really like Allison.  Quirky, odd, very smart. Also not the same as me which is a big plus.

Okay.  Monday I had drinks with a woman who got in touch via OKC.  She's a therapist.  The date was like a classic Woody Allen movie, in a good way.  I was all confidence and calm.  She was all neuroses and intelligence.  Helen.  We will see each other again.  A person of substance.  Good conversation.  Quick wit.  Am I physically attracted to her?  I don't know.

Marianne I've not met in person.  We were supposed to meet for drinks tomorrow, but her work caused her to reschedule.  She's a DNC press secretary working on the Obama re-election campaign in Virginia.  Every single part of her OKC profile included an unattributed quote from The Big Lebowski which is a major bonus in my book.  We started emailing outside of OKC which got me her real name which I then googled.  Turns out she was a concert cellist before ditching that to work for the first Obama campaign.  Weird.  Looked at her Twitter feed, and it included Nico Muhly.  Seems like we'll have a lot to talk about.

Robin (antiques mall) is achingly beautiful.  But she's a libertarian, and I just can't talk to her.

Allison is a microbiologist working on a masters in public health.

Wow.

I have been in that extreme bummer situation at least twice. All head trip. If you're lucky, she'll be there for the morning wood. But still. 

I am so amazed by these stories. And, like, what happens in the cosmic sense to turn things around like this, you know? I'm in 100% support of this impulse to go ask out Robin regardless of whether you ever see her again. That is rad. 

It's hard to find that combo of Enough Like You + Not Like You. Any developments?</br></br>

Allison and I were making out. She said, "Are you doing this with other people, too?"  I said, "Absolutely not."  She said, "Yeah, but are you, like, dating other people?"  I'm like, "Well, yeah."  She's like, "Hmm.  No judgment or anything, but if we're going to be doing this, I'm not sure I'm down with that."  Not exactly angry, but gets herself together and goes home.  I think for a couple of days.  I talk to several friends.  I decide I'd rather see where things go with her than have an ongoing string of first dates.  I call her, ask her if she can meet.  She's tentative.  She comes over.  I tell her that I'd like to see her and will happily cancel the dates with other women.  She's into that.  

Since then, lots of time together.  It's enjoyable.  Long term?  For once I'm really not thinking about it.

What's the happs with you?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I've still never seen "Boogie Nights."  Not sure if this clip makes me want to see it more or less.  Hilarious, but really sad, too.

Have you seen the clip from David Cross's new comedy?  Maybe you posted it, I dunno.  But it's really funny.   Will Arnett is at his best when he is completely unrestrained by decency, like in the Will Arnett sex tape thing.

Looks like I'm dating someone regular-like.  Allison.  Getting her masters in public health.  Microbiology background.  Can't tell what this is about yet.  She's very unlike anyone I've dated before in that we've had very different preoccupations/cultural fixations, etc.  Nerdy in a good way.  Doesn't seem very pensive which is really refreshing.  Is this one for the long-term?  No idea, but it's nice to have someone to hang out with and touch some.  Being alone is awfully unnatural when compared to having a mate, isn't it?

This is the time of year when I drink a lot.

I've been working some.  A friend and his wife have a design/build firm--they took over my shop when I got really sick.  The shop has recently moved, so we're getting set up in the new space.  It's hot as a motherfucker over here already.  Please tell Lawrence to invite me to Vermont or Maine or wherever.  Tell him I'm a gen-yoo-ine a bon vivant.

Speaking of Lawrence, I can't tell you how many people I've told that story about the "teledildonics" lady.  The topic comes up regularly with my friend Reid.  We try to work the concept into all sorts of situations.</br></br>

HOw's shiz? We got back Saturday. Super fun drive down. Stayed in Portland, near the Redwoods, S.F. for three nights, San Luis Obispo, then home. Now we're just getting adjusted here.

Still hanging with the lady?</br></br>

<b> Jul 7, 2011, at 2:57 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I'm bailing on my Allison situation.  Here are my deep thoughts from last night.

*****************

Time to get my head straight.

First, I have been completely honest about EVERYTHING this time, so I can take comfort in that.

Second, I like her and am happy to hang out with her.

Third, I'm having a hard time seeing this one as a long term prospect.  BUT WHY?

On the one hand, it's refreshing to date someone so dissimilar to me.  While I grew up tormented and fascinated by art, she grew up extroverted and interested in science.

She doesn't get my humor all that much.  That bums me out.

The sex is a mix of great and okay.  I want to say that's always the case, but it isn't.  Sometimes it's awesome, sometimes it's not.  

I'd like to be able to hang out, have sex, stay a while, and then go home and sleep alone.  Not particularly PC, but there you have it.

Is she worthy of my trust?  The iPhone/text thing the other day was really weird and disconcerting.  What if she's a big-time liar?  How would I know?  She says she definitely has trust issues.  Do people who are straightforward truth-tellers usually have those? I don't know.  Funny how a little thing like looking at a text on my phone made me so doubtful.

I haven't made any promises.

Is she wise?  Isn't that the question that I've told my self I must ask?  

She doesn't seem to be a deeply introspective type of person.  Maybe I have enough introspection for two people.

LISTEN: What's with the crying at odd times?  It's happened several times.  Once during intense sexual activity focused on her.  Once during a drunken argument about pharmaceutical companies.  Some other time, too?

Is she being straightforward with me?  Why do I have doubts?  Is it a response to her or is it baggage from my marriage?</br></br>

Fair amount of dating here. Not much else. Saw "Beginners" yesterday. Found it a bit labored. Weirdly, the woman with whom I saw it was Mike Mill's neighbor growing up. 

Sent via telegraph</br></br>

<b> Jul 25, 2011, at 1:31 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Huh. That film sounded interesting. Is Mills the guy married to Miranda July?

So no aftermath to the breakup with Allison? "Fair amount of dating"
sounds pretty okay.

Right now I'm in San Diego where Alison is doing one of her periodic
catering jobs for Bill Gates' family. She's been doing them a couple
times a year for a while now. It's lavish. They pay her well, feed her
VERY well, and she's put up in this lovely cottage near the Del Mar
racetrack. They have a chef who travels with them, along with his
assistant, a server (in this case Alison), and occasional others. The
significant others often tag along since you can eat / drink / stay
for free. The scale of this lifestyle is like a tiny taste of how the
Gates' live. They're blowing probably in the tens of thousands a day,
every day, just living life. They, of course, do not even notice the
nice meals and alcohol the catering staff buy on their dime. Part of
the per diem.

Otherwise, most of my time right now is spent working on a TV pitch
about a guy who gets fed up, drops out of corporate America, and joins
the French Foreign Legion. Kid you not.

Your TV pitch sounds interesting.  So would an American take on "Upstairs/Downstairs" about the lives of a tech tycoon and the staff who serves him and his family.

Yeah, the dating is okay.  I am flat-out "playing the field."  Not sleeping with multiple people or anything.  Just meeting a lot of people.  Met an Obama re-election staffer on Saturday who's one of the main people running the campaign here in VA.  Was a pretty successful classical cellist before that.  Totally brilliant, very attractive, totally workaholic.</br></br>

I kinda like some of this menswear, though some of it is annoyingly steampunk or something.

Do you follow The Sartorialist?  Click the link men's clothing link.  I'm telling you, those europeans (especially Italian men) know how the hell to dress without being all sissified about it.

A salt water pool, huh?  Nice.  No chlorine?  Charging any kind of cocktail to BG's tab is SO.FUCKING.AWESOME.I.CAN'T.STAND.IT.

So interesting to hear Marianne talk about her career as a classical musician.  She said that orchestra musicians have one of the very lowest job satisfaction averages of any profession.  It gets to be like being paid to type, apparently.</br></br>

<b> Jul 25, 2011, at 6:09 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> What's going on with the ex-cellists?

I'm here to tell you that if you can have a cellist in your house on a
regular basis, you want that.

Workaholic, maybe not so much. Though there are worse -aholisms.

I can't tell if the Gates gig lends itself to the U/D thing. Her
interactions with the family are so limited. They seem to know and
remember her, and they like her because she's familiar and efficient,
but her contact is limited. She's never spoken to Bill himself,
although he helped her move a table once. It's mostly Melinda (the
wife) she deals with. But maybe the full-time staff would have better
stories? You'd think that would be a pretty awesome spin on U/D
though.

I just swam in a salt water pool and charged a manhattan to my room.
Two things I've never done before. No, three: I've never tasted a
manhattan before.

I also just bought a pretty rad Ben Sherman suit online for the
wedding. Charcoal, with almost indiscernable blue/brown stripes. My
God, men's suits are boring. And don't even get me started on men's
shoes.  It's almost impossible to find anything with personality.
Barring, of course, the Sean John shiny silver suits aimed at wannabe
African-American moguls. I am no Andre 3000. Also, weird factoid:
nearly impossible to find a three-piece suit nowadays. There are a few
but nothing with style. No, not true: there are Asian ones with style,
but the style is that of a South Korean karaoke star.

Sent from my iPhone. Expect typos.</br></br>

<b> Sep 1, 2011, at 9:05 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> It was extremely positive.  We're making plans to see each other again on Sunday.

Things are a tad complicated.  I've been seeing this woman Marianne pretty regularly.  Can't remember if I'd mentioned her?  She's an Obama staffer working on the re-election campaign here in VA.  She works round the clock, 24/7.  We see each other once per week, and it pretty much always goes like this: Dinner and drinks, Netflix, sex, sleep, coffee, seeya.  On our second date we spelled out some boundaries for this thing: she doesn't have much to give, and I need to continue seeing other people.

The thing is, we're both feeling kinda tender towards one another, and that wasn't exactly a part of the plan.  It's nice -BUT-

Marianne will almost certainly be moved out of VA in November or December, and she'll have even less time for a life in the year leading up to the election.  Also, while she's fun to be around, I'm nowhere near thinking she'd be a suitable long-term mate.  She could be, but it'd be a long time before I felt I could say so.

Anyhoo, enter Jill.  Kroger Jill.  The first date was exceptional.  I've now been out on dozens of OKC dates, so I know when one's shitty and when one's good.  We had a lot to talk about and a lot in common.  What if I'm inclined to pursue something more substantial with her?  What happens with Marianne?  Marianne and I talked about this some last night, and it seems like we both know what the risks are in all of this.  Still, it's a situation I've never really been in before.

Did you ever see "My Architect?"  Maybe I'll just become one of those dudes.</br></br>

Collee wants me to write a book about dating.  I think it's more like a pamphlet than a book.  God knows I've bogged down on And Now for Some Droll Observations.

All of this is stream-of-consciousness tequila talk.

I'm not crazy about Ryan Adams, but that first solo record is pretty good.  I like that song  "Come Pick Me Up."  I'd like someone to come pick me up and feed me.

<b> Sep 1, 2011, at 12:52 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Oh shit. You met her at a Kroger? Not even like Trader Joe's? Not some high end Whole Foods type place that people dress up to go to??

You are a god.

Feeling tender is what repeated sex does. If Marianne is moving within three months then it seems to me you can't make plans there. I mean, no question you gotta give Kroger Jill every chance.

I've never seen "My Architect." I have, however, seen "Two and a Half Men," so maybe you could become Charlie Sheen.

</b> <br><br> Well, I'm looking forward to date #2 with Kroger Jill on Sunday.  I think we're going to see that new thriller with Helen Mirren.

You know what's been great about dating so many different people?  It's kept me from prematurely focusing on any single woman.  That's been my M.O., and it's been to my detriment throughout my life.  There's a part of me that thinks I may not actually want a real relationship.  Maybe I just want to date endlessly.  I enjoy all kinds of things about the process, and not primarily the sexual aspects.  I dunno.

Hey, I've got a pretty long layover in LA on the 17th.  Flight arrives around 11 AM.  Flight to Seattle leaves after 6 PM.  I'd like to leave LAX and do something in LA, but I'm not sure what.  I've been there several times, but only when I was doing focus group shit, so I never saw anything but business parks.  You know what I'd really love?  Some kind of day spa.  But a day spa that is not a) a gay bathhouse or b) insanely expensive.  I'm not even sure what I mean, exactly.  Any recommendations?</br></br>

<b> Sep 1, 2011, at 6:32 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I think Project Runway looks pretty interesting.  People who care about design making stuff.  Sounds good.  But I don't have cable.

Scott is a very deeply troubled soul.  I know what it's like to look at the world through a prism as fundamentally distorted as his, and because of that, I remain loyal to him as a friend.  But it's an odd friendship in that I derive no pleasure, no satisfaction, no sense of camaraderie from it.  I just can't bring myself to ditch him.  He destroys every relationship he touches.  He alienates everyone who might otherwise stay close.  It's just awful.  He's in therapy now, trying to deal with the hideous past that made him the way he is, and I hope he finds some measure of peace.  The most recent kerfuffle occurred over a dating prospect of his.  It's a long story.  Essentially, he warded me off some woman after they'd exchange a single email through OKC, referring to the "bros befoe hoes" rule.  I very gently objected because I'm not willing to be warded off every person he merely emails.  He went ballistic.  It got smoothed out, but only after the kind of grueling effort one usually associates with conflict resolution in a (troubled) primary relationship.  So much drama, pretty much all the time.  My heart goes out to Scott.  He hates himself with such vigor.  He is so lost in his broken, pained ego.  But episodes like that make me want to withdraw.  If not completely, then still a whole lot.

I was just curious about whether Alison has had a mostly west coast life.  Seems so foreign to me.  Also I hold out the hope that you and she will make an east coast tour at some point and we can all go to Perly's.

Re. prehensile dolphin dicks: Last night Marianne suggested that a dolphin dick could grab my dick and jerk it off.  She coined the phrase "dick job" (as opposed, I guess, to "hand job") to describe this act.  I laughed and laughed.  

Yeah, I could probably handle a Power Point presentation.  Maybe that'd be a good medium for me.

<b> Sep 1, 2011, at 8:56 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Vito's does look like it would have lady cougars there. In this case, I think it also has some stuffed cat or something. I've been there once but I forget. 

I so do not work for PR anymore. Though I'm totally following the show now. How could I not? I know everything about each of the contestants. Lately I've been picking up little gigs here and there and coasting off Alison's income. I'll have to buckle down after the wedding. But I do hope to avoid the reality world again.

Dude, Scott seems to be losing his mind. He really got pissed that I yanked the East Coast's chain over that earthquake. Then he started "liking" anything anyone wrote about me on FB that seemed snippy at all. What a weirdo. It was a joke. Last night I spent a good bit of time trying to win him over by posting all kinds of trivia about science fiction on his status. I dunno. 

What's your story with him?

Alison is from outside Seattle. She's spent time in NYC and DC and Paris. But that's it. Why?

What would one grab with one's penis, one wonders? The last beer in the fridge? Chips at the 7-11? Pump gas?

I think you should make a Power Point presentation about dating. 

I love the shit out of that Ryan Adams song. So poignant it kills me. Best record he's done by far, but so good that I forgive him his excesses since.</br></br>

<b> Sep 1, 2011, at 10:13 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> PR is totally available without commercials online. Just Google "Project Runway 9." 

I haven't had close dealings with Scott in a long time but it seems to me his situation must be getting worse if that's how it is with him. That bums me out. I really love that guy.

I think it's inevitable that we'll come east at some point. If fact, David Durst asked if a bunch of people could pool money to bring us there instead of coming to Seattle. We just couldn't face the prospect of flying out there directly after wedding / honemoon, though. Plus we're already on the hook to do an L.A. event for people who weren't invited up north. Ugh.

Mmmmm Perly's. 

Is it gay if it's a dolphin? So many questions...

Dude, that Will Smith deal was the one that snapped my mind. I truly could not grasp where the fuck that came from. Like, what psyche. Sooooo disturbing.

Okay, time to work on some music. I've been trying to bust ass on songs while Alison is away and the rent is paid...</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yes, my dolphin boyfriend (Bruce) is gay.  Jamie and I share him.  Long story...and a retarded one at that.

My hope is that things are getting worse for Scott on their way to getting better. I wish he could spend several months in the day-program for sexual abuse survivors that I participated in in DC.  His past is so awful.  It's a bit of a miracle that he's not dead or in prison.  I guess that's a part of why I remain engaged with him.

I'm extremely amused at how repulsive you're finding that site!  Sounds like it's the precise reaction I have to Tim & Eric.  It's a kind of horror. The krauts have a word for this, no doubt.  Shit, the Japanese probably have several names for it in their bizarrely over-developed aesthetics.

Looking forward to checking out PR.</br></br>

<b> Sep 2, 2011, at 7:37 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Whenever Marianne and I hang out, I inevitably share weird tidbits of information with her which she flat-out accuses me of making up.  Afterwards I end up sending her links to substantiate all my claims.  E.g., foot X-ray machines at shoe stores, prehensile dolphin penises, that burning smell emanating from a fire in the Dismal Swamp, etc.

Maybe this could be what "Real Shit About Eagles" is all about.  Weird facts that seem made up, but aren't.  Contemporary twist on Ripley's or something.

Or, maybe I could just get a tee-shirt that says "Real Shit About Eagles" and leave it at that.</br></br>

That story is just weird enough to be paradoxically unsurprising.</br></br>

<b> Sep 2, 2011, at 10:49 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> It would be an awesome YouTube series. Basically, it's you in bed with a woman, you tell her some insane shit, she accuses you of making it up, then you show her the actual news clip or whatever. And you make all kinds of racy jokes about it.

Not quite as great a concept as Drunk History, but it's mostly in the execution, probably.</br></br>

<b> Sep 5, 2011, at 12:40 AM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I basically hate blues unless I can hear the dust on the 78. So this stuff is kinda whatever to me. Plus I can mostly only hear him singing in funny voices. 

I liked Emma Thompson's line "like a well-hung eel." 

I am eager to hear about the Jill thing.</br></br>

<b> Sep 5, 2011, at 6:10 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Totally.  That eel comment was the best part.  A lugubriously well-hung eel.  What a strange compliment.

As for the blues, did you see this recently?  

Jill.  Forgive me if I've already said some of this in a previous email.  Okay.  Well, I've been on so, so many dates over the past six months, and my senses have gotten pretty fine-tuned about whether or not there's chemistry.  Some dates have it, some don't.  But none have had the sort of eye-contact-feeling-of-connection thing going on.  In truth, that's been a relief since that kind of instant chemistry has led me down some unhelpful paths.  On the other hand, I've been somewhat afraid that maybe I'm too jaded and used-up to ever feel that sort of thing again.  Anyway, over the course of the few minutes that Jill and I chatted in the Kroger line, I had a few flashes of that feeling, and it was categorically different from the kinds of emotions I've been experiencing during all these dates.  Now, I'm finally wise enough to know that feeling stuff like that doesn't predict anything about one's future with a woman, but I gotta say, it was nice to feel it.  

Anyhoo.  First date was your standard slightly exhilarating, slightly awkward chat over drinks.  But there was definitely a) chemistry and b) a lot in common.  We're both preoccupied with craft, music, movies, other cultural whatnot, friends, nieces and nephews.  We're both 2 years out of lousy marriages and we're both interested in maintaining a bit more alone time than is the norm in primary relationships.  She seems smart but not really driven or intense about it.  She seems very direct and honest without being callous. 

Yesterday was our second date.  "The Debt" followed by dinner.  Then lots of talking and making out.  She loves The Big Lebowski and Hedwig.  I don't know, dude.  There's just an awful lot here.  I think it would be easy to spend a lot of time with her.  And she doesn't seem in the least self-loathing or insane.  Obviously, it takes time to assess that stuff, but early signs are good.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Marianne told me that stat about low job satisfaction. She also said that orchestra musicians were more jaded, bitter, and miserable than even the most seasoned political operatives. They're all broke. Competing to keep their seats. Working three jobs. The surgeries start in their 30s and never stop. Blah!

<b> Sep 5, 2011, at 2:47 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Here's how it went down at Kroger.

It was a Tuesday night.  Wasn't looking for anything.  Wasn't all horny or worked up (like I usually am) or scoping out the many fine ladies who usually populate the Carytown store.  For god's sake, I wasn't even dressed very well.

BUT.  I walked past Jill and thought, Wow.  I like her.  Who knows why?  It wasn't just that she was physically attractive, although that clearly the main thing. Still, I had a good feeling or something.

When it was time to get in a checkout line, I looked at my options.  Two lines seemed about the same length, and Jill was in one of them.  So I chose that one.  At this point, it still would have been difficult to strike up conversation.  I mean, what does one say?  "Hey, far out! I like that same spaghetti sauce?"  And so, like, in a nutshell, there you have the problem of hitting on women in the grocery store.  Everyone's thinking about it, but there's just no good way to break the ice.  

That's when I got my big break.  Everything that can possibly go wrong in a checkout line went wrong.  One customer didn't have enough money, but wanted to argue and haggle and cause a scene.  The next customer forgot something and wandered back into the store for an eternity before returning to the register.  I saw my way in.  I just said something to Jill like, "This is proof positive that the worst line at the store is always the one you're in."

BOOM!  Connection made.  Within maybe 1.5 minutes we established some common interests.  When she was leaving with her bags, there was no way I was going to let the moment slip past.  A simple, "May I call you sometime?" got me her business card.  I called the next day.  

There you have it.</br></br>

Not important but I also went to see THE DEBT the other night. Enjoyed it. Also cracked up at the Clapton thing before. What a goon.

So back up a step. You're in Kroger. You get a good vibe. What did you do? Did you just go: you seem nice, want to get a drink sometime? 

The whole thing sounds so good. How you sort that out with the other ladyfriend I do not know. But it sounds like that was temporary anyway.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yes.  I think that's it.  Dudes should go out at night with the express goal of getting rejected.  

When we're teens, we're so self-conscious, so full of trepidation and doubt. Rejection looms large in all kinds of ways.  Embarrassment.   But then, a lot of us stay in that space, you know?  

Figuring out that one has absolutely zero to lose is the key.</br></br>

The main people I remember from the corner are:

- Marie Sirotniak, who is awesome.
- Heather Caudill, former roommate, who is very not awesome.
- This woman - Melissa? - who was the manager, very mousey and quiet, who got trashed at a party and flat-out propositioned me by grabbing my shirt (hers was half open and she didn't know it) and refusing to let me go until I went home with her. You'd think that's this fantasy scenario come true, but it was awful. I eventually escaped.

Marie had that total WW2 pinup power. Not a waifish little stick, just hotter than blazes. And wicked smart and confident.

I can't swear the manager's name was Melissa. I forget. But it freaked me right the fuck out. I think she was in serious psychiatric trouble. For real. 

The bachelor party was basically a dozen dudes sitting around grilling and drinking. It was perfect. I was 100% not up for allegedly amusing shenanigans. Or public humiliation. It was great.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2011, at 9:28 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Yeah, this woman was not one of them. They hired her to oversee stuff. She later shacked up with this dude Chris (?) who was an architect and lived down in the bottom. I have wondered from time to time what happened to Karen and Marianne. They were super cool. I think Marianne maybe lived in NC for a while? At this point their kids would be friggin out of college. Oy.</br></br>

<b> Sep 12, 2011, at 10:03 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Yeah, Marie was living suspiciously large. From fencing bikes, no doubt.

I thought both those women were super cool, though Marianne more so. When I went in to apply for the job the first time, I asked for an application but Marianne didn't want me to fill one out, she simply asked why she should hire me. So I told her.

When I left the funny farm. 
Now that's a good friend. 

In the dark ages
I dated an ex of Bob's. 
I'm still sorry, bro. 

How to be happy:
No white after Labor Day. 
Scotch when it's cold out. 

Drinking is an art. 
You shouldn't _over_ do it. 
But you _should_ do it. 

When your spouse gets sick,
Chances are you'll get sick, too. 
Share and share alike. 

You're not in the mood?
Try giving it five minutes. 
That will often help. 

Roses are reddish. 
Violets are purple-blue. 
Pearls are pearlescent. 

He's a mechanic. 
She's a hot librarian. 
Soon, all bets are off. 

How to be happy:
No white after Labor Day. 
Scotch when it's cold out.

I am so grateful to you both for getting me out there. I think the whole thing qualifies as a highlight of my life. 

I just got home 5 mins ago. 

Making an omelet then crashing. 

Hope you two have a great honeymoon. I look forward to hearing all about it!

The first five days on the beach in Mexico was paradise. And then the last three days in Havana was indescribable. We should do a phoner for that one. Havana truly defies description. Some weird mashup of Prague, inner city Detroit circa 1957 and 2011 simultaneously, and maybe Kingston or Port-au-Prince.

Let me know when a good day / time to talk would be.  I would imagine that right now you and your lovely bride are enjoying settling in after the wedding buildup, wedding, and honeymoon.  

Also: Based on how that little booklet of haikus went over at the party, I've been thinking I'd like to do something with it.  Not sure what "something" means, but am open to suggestions if you have any.  Seems like it could be a nice point-of-sale tchotchke at quirky gift shops, indie book/comic stores, and so on.  At some point I'd like to get high-res scans.</br></br>

<b> Oct 1, 2011, at 6:49 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I think it's a totally valid goal for art. But it can totally be a lame trick too. Especially when applied as a blunt instrument.

One of my favorite things with GRB songs is making people uncomfortable. It's pretty easy because the music tends to be so pretty that you can slide in something embarrassing or icky or challenging or truthful without much struggle. I love it when people react with discomfort to my songs. You certainly can't shock people through the usual "punk rock" methods anymore.

But I'm doing it with a greater goal in mind, not just to fuck with people. Well, maybe a little.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Those Talk Talk records make me uncomfortable, but they're also lush and beautiful.  I think your songs are, too.

I wouldn't say that your songs make me feel uncomfortable, though.  There can be some uncomfortable feelings...but for me they're a channel to some other emotion.  Kong Meets His Maker is the perfect example.  Everything about that song is uncomfortable right down to the way the strings gliss doesn't resolve the way one expects.  But as a listener, all those elements combine to connect me to real shit about love.  It's emotionally epic.

But there's something else afoot recently, right?  Like, I think there's an awful lot of confusion going around between discomfort and profundity.  I feel like I encounter a lot of stuff these days where the spareness and awkwardness doesn't connect to anything much.  It'd be like if Cormac McCarthy's prose wasn't about anything but his own social insecurities.</br></br>

Cool re. Alison's new job. Is it the type of thing she's glad to be doing?

Writing teen suicide prevention doesn't sound all bad to me. Important topic in any case. Better when written by a bit of a fuckup, I'd think. As opposed to like a psychologist who studies that horrible phenomenon. 

In related news, I'm in fairly bad shape, I'm afraid. Had to get off of effective depression meds because of side effects. We were hoping that my brain could do without 'em and the side effects would go away. Side effects stayed--apparently caused by something else--so am getting back on them. It'll probably be 2 weeks before I reach effective levels. I'll be okay--it's been worse before. 

In any case I'm winning the lottery tonight which I expect will help some. 

Any other work prospects on your horizon?

Alison's happy to do this gig I think. It suits her skill set. Also she works on the Sony lot and they feed her. I'm curious to see what happens.

<b> Oct 12, 2011, at 10:23 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> She's serious. She might have a real mental illness though. Not schizophrenia but something on that family tree. Because she was one person with me and my collaborator Marianne and another person when we're not around. She's very smart. Very personable. Very reasonable when your'e in front of her face. But then on her own time descends into these paranoid delusions. I was getting tons of spam from her during the election about Obama being the Antichrist. 

Even the Tea Partiers get freaked out by her. There's video out there of her crashing a Tea Party party and they kind of look at her askance and try to make her go away.

She comes from a strict Baptist background. She moved to Hollywood, started hanging out at the Playboy mansion (as a virgin), then shacked up with some gypsy dude, had a daughter with him, did tons of blow, got on SNL. Then at the peak of her career quit SNL to marry a cop in Florida, with whom she now has another daughter. Those are kind of the two sides of her personality. I feel the most for her teenage daughter Aubrey, who's super cool and very quiet and has Seen It All™. An old soul. Not shocked by any nutty thing her mom says or does. Just rolls with it. 

Marianne sent me that video and we reaffirmed our sense of relief that we dodged that bullet.</br></br>

REM, yeah.  These were my profound thoughts at the time:

Three of the 4 people who changed my life over the course of about 40 minutes in 1985 have decided at long last to formally retire their collaboration. With nothing but fondness and appreciation in my heart, I acknowledge that the time for this probably arrived a while back, but also: congratulations gentleman, and best wishes for all your future creative projects.</br></br>

3.  I'm willing and able to make anything.  Almost anything: I don't do upholstery.  The real question is: What do you two want / need? That's the place to start.  The other starting point is: What's your aesthetic?  What do you like?

<b> Oct 23, 2011, at 6:31 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Her mom kinda reminds me of my mom a bit. Nice enough, kinda manipulative / passive-aggressive, liberal but light-blue collar. Sells Mary-Kay cosmetics. Goes to Unitarian church because she's "spiritual" and wants to prove it--mostly to Alison. Married to this guy who's kind of an old hippie biker dude, Marv. Alison talks to her mom regularly but her mom always accuses her of calling only when she wants something. Yet they're pretty tight.

Alison's dad killed himself when she was 11. He was an alcoholic depressive. He revered Alison but was divorced from her mom pretty early on, like when Alison was 2 or something. Alison says that when she got that phone call she knew what he'd done before anyone told her. It haunts her though she doesn't say much about it. 

Alison kinda hated Marv for a long time and her mom was kind of useless during adolescence, so she has these kind of spiritual parents, Mary and Steve. Steve is the guy who married us, and they both inspected me pretty thoroughly the first time I went up to visit / woo Alison. It was their vetting that really counted. We blew right through Alison's mom's house in like ten minutes. Steve and Mary were kinda like Alison's youth group leaders, but they essentially adopted lots of emotionally abandoned kids who were friends with their daughters.</br></br>

I got your contact info from Julie Polter at Sojourner's.  She and I have a mutual friend who recently got married in Seattle.  The bride asked folks to write a haiku or two to share at the reception; I went overboard, creating a short booklet of illustrated haikus.  Several people at the wedding (and since) have suggested that it's the kind of thing that might interest McSweeney's, so I thought I'd send it along for your consideration.  I'd like to think it would make a nice Valentine's gift.  Below are some scans from the book.  If you'd like to see more, please do let me know.

</b> <br><br> I think the classics are Swordfish Trombones, Raindogs, Frank's Wild Years, and Bone Machine.

I think this is the best one since Bone Machine, but not in the same class as it or those others.

It's very straightforward.  He's like one of those slightly elderly blues dudes.  It's nice how short the songs are.  The good songs are super-good.  Maybe it's like a weird synthesis of the early singer-songwriter stuff and the post-1980 persona stuff?  It sounds very band-like.

I hope you and Alison have fun.  Please do let me know what the best costume is.  I would expect LA to bring it.</br></br>

What ya got goin' on over there?  

Trying to get one of these film / TV projects to go forward so I can get paid. It's a slog. Promising but sloggish. Also, today, working on a new idea for a film. Again, sloggy.


Find what you need at IKEA?  

Finally, yes, on the third trip. We needed blinds for the bedroom. We found one of the right length and color on our first trip but then they were out. Second trip, no dice. Third trip, we got the last one -- again. So now we have blinds on both our bedroom windows. Sheesh.

Three times I've been there and I still haven't tried the  meatballs.


How is married life 2 months in?  (I assume it's fantastic.)  

It is fantastic.

Although she's going to Jamaica for work for nine days over Thanksgiving while I stay here. Very mixed feelings about that. 


Any further furniture thoughts / musings / discussions?  I'm making a bed for Scott right now.

We're talking dining table. With leaves for expansion. (Is this a thing you can do? Within wedding gift parameters?) Though we haven't figured out a style or anything. I've been bugging her. We probably need to look at some examples. 


What are you working on?

A film idea about a kid with muscular dystrophy in real life who is a heroic knight (or something) when he's in Second Life (online virtual world). And how he uses that to land a girl, defeat a bully, and restore his family. I'm going for full-on, big ticket, Oscar nominated, seven digit sales figure type script. If possible. I'm so sick of being on this hamster wheel.


How do you feel about an Arrested Development movie?

Pinging between doubtful and cautiously optimistic? You?


Me:

I was supposed to go to Bill & Hillary Clinton's house on Friday, but my involvement got nixed. No kidding.  I'm bummed it's not going to happen.

What's the story with that?


I like Jill a lot.  Weird verb choice?  Yes, but it's accurate.

What's up on that front?


It would be nice to talk to you at great length about faith some day.  Mine appears to be completely gone.  My view is that the best one can do with one's despair is just be a good sport about it.  The story of Christ's life, death, and resurrection mean nothing to me now, at least intellectually.  I don't say that happily.  It's a loss.  Am I the rocky soil on which the seeds were tossed, but nothing grew?  Fuuuuck.  I don't think so, or at least I hope not.  I'm not going to use that stuff to tear myself down.  It's just that I'm living an incredibly nihilistic life these days.  Where. The fuck.  Is the meaning?  (Rhetorical question, don't worry.)

Well, the 'dark night of the soul' / apparent silence of God is well documented among people who go down the path of faith. (Which is not to diminish what you're saying at all.) I think your emotional mourning / yearning for that connection says something. And in a perversely hopeful way, I think that an emotional response to the Christ story is more real than any intellectual response, especially among eggheads like us, who have a hard time with emotions but find being thinky very easy. But, yes, that's a phone convo probably. 

I think even Jesus would understand a creeping apathy about his story. Not to be blasphemous, but it's overworked. I can barely even register it anymore when I read the Bible. I suspect the real test would be what happens if you find yourself in Jesus's presence. My feeling is that it is / would be so overwhelming, and the power in it so uncontroversial, that any of us would fall over in joy / terror. If there's any meaning, it's in there somewhere. Not some intellectual construct (which we're all prone to make).


Had a beautiful party last Saturday out at Harrison's estate.  My friend Jamie camped out the night before, woke up at 4:50 to begin smoking two pig shoulders.  It was warm that evening, so we ate by candlelight at a massive granite table Harrison had moved there with a crane.  Roz was there.  So was Jill.  Corner reunion party, I guess.

Oh man I want to go to a Corner reunion party. Except for that manager chick who freaked me out that time. Ask Jill if she can remember her name. She was real quiet. Until she was drunk and manic and sexually voracious.</br></br>

<b> Nov 16, 2011, at 3:42 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I want to respond to all of your responses, but I'm thumb typing. At a bar. The waitress I love is waiting on me tonight.

Jill. She's great. Many points of connection. She's a thoroughly decent, sane person. Good sense of humor. EXXXtremely sexy (sorry, bad boundaries). Very, very kind. Not as emotionally aware as most of my friends. Different cultural points of reference. Smart, but (you're my friend, so forgive me in advance) not as smart as me and my friends. I am not in love with her after 2.5 months.  I've never had a woman be so good to me. She's great, and I'm conflicted. 

Thank you for you preliminary thoughts in re. to my faithlessness. A phone convo might really help.  Let's talk orthopraxy vs. orthodoxy?

What's the mix in your mixed feelings about Alison's trip to Jamaica?

Clintons: Harrison makes stuff for them now. Needed my help for a delivery. Only then he didn't. I'd been rehearsing what I'd say to Bill. H hasn't met him. Knows Hillary pretty well now, though.

I don't know.  "Womanizer?"  "Ladies' Man?" "Polyamorist?" "Ethical Slut?"  Take your pick.

They say they want honesty.  You spend your whole life practicing honesty.  You learn to differentiate between discreet / caring honesty vs. plain-old brusque rudeness.  You learn that lying by omission isn't fair play, and you stop doing that.  You explore how being candid doesn't necessarily let you off the hook for anything.  You try to not just tell the truth, but to _be_ the true version of yourself.  To show them the true person.  To not front.

And then you give them the honesty they say they want, and BOOM!  It's over.

In short, I was not ready to seal things up with Jill in a tight, exclusive commitment.  She was.  I had zero desire to sever our connection.  Between all or nothing, she has chosen nothing.  She dumped me with what everyone has agreed was kind of a mean note left at my doorstep.  I know she's just hurt and angry, but sheesh.  No need to twist the knife.

I don't really think I'm a womanizer or a ladies' man, by the way.  Maybe I just like the process of dating more than the reality of being with one person.

Divorce fucking crushed my last illusions about love.  I'm positive that what I'm left with is much better.  But not so sure that many women see it like I do.

I wish I had something smart and helpful to say about that. If I really engage my imagination, I can imagine giving yourself over to love, being blindsided by betrayal, and then feeling like the commitment was a sucker's game. I mean, if Alison did to me what Chesley did to you, I'd be a wreck. That said, not all people / women are, like, clinically dissociative, or whatever Chesley is. Obviously.

I'd say I have a pretty strong feminist streak but I'd also say that women, no matter what your sophomore girlfriend tells you, are more prone to want commitment and exclusivity and such. But then I'd also say that you might find someone you truly want to commit to, and that you've been a little ambivalent about Jill from the beginning.

I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe I'm saying don't take Jill as the sole specimen in your control group. Or something.

In other bad news:

Los Angeles, Nov. 22 -- Chris Vrenna, the Grammy-award winning musician and producer who was most recently the drummer/keyboardist for Marilyn Manson, has left the band to focus on his growing film and video game scoring, production career and DJ outings as well as work on the forthcoming 2012 Tweaker release.
 
"I'm incredibly proud of the work I did with Manson and look forward to the release of Born Villain.  I wish my brothers well but with the recording largely completed I felt it was time to return to other facets of my career which involves production work, film scoring, and future musical collaborations," explained Vrenna.
 
Vrenna rose to prominence in the early '90s as a full-time member of Nine Inch Nails, having been a permanent member of Trent Reznor's band since Nine Inch Nails' inception and for the following eight years.  His production and programming credits include the aforementioned Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson, Guns'n'Roses and most recently work on Evanescence's self-titled 2011 album.  Vrenna is also a sought after remixer working on tracks by U2, Nelly Furtado, Rammstein, and Slipknot.</br></br>

She'd put in the request two days ago, as required, and no one said anything. She ran out of meds days ago. I thought she was gonna melt down. BUt we spotted her doctor on the sidewalk, he was filling in for someone. He was super nice and pissed that his staff had failed.

Lady's out of town until the 30th. It's weirdly quiet here.</br></br>

<b> Nov 25, 2011, at 5:49 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Details are still sketchy, but...

Opens in a fantasy world, this warrior guy stalking something in this ravishingly beautiful landscape. Turns out to be a fairy princess (or somesuch). But just as he's making contact with her, this horde of bad warrior guys sweep in and kidnap her. They're led by this talking dragon, who taunts our warrior guy. Battle ensues. He gets killed. Cut to:

A kid in a wheelchair playing World of Warcraft (or similar). He's got muscular dystrophy. His mom looks after him. His dad was a doctor but also frustrated by his inability to cure the kid, became a drunk, smashed some stuff, lost his medical license, and now is under a serious restraining order--no contact with mom or kid. The kid hasn't seen his dad in years. The kid is also kind of a smartass and has made an enemy of this high school toughguy. And he's got a crush on this cute gothy girl, the one who's playing the fairy princess in WoW. She doesn't know he's the warrior guy. 

Basically, it's about his pursuit of her through the game, since inside he's able-bodied and a kickass warrior, etc. She, on the other hand, uses the game as an escape from her bad home situation. Her folks are rich but mostly ignore her and they're both having affairs with other people but she's the only one who knows. She's sort of dating the toughguy. 

As it goes along, the game sequences revolve around his quest to rescue her from the talking dragon and his minions. The dragon mostly taunts him, dares him to get strong enough to make a good foe. But eventually the dragon seems to know stuff about the kid's real life. So the kid enlists a hacker buddy to find out who's behind the dragon, to get dirt on him, etc. 

The girl's parents are so focused on hiding their respective affairs that they both miss her 16th (probably) birthday. They're also freaked out by her gothy look and have her on anti-depressants unnecessarily. But she's falling in love with the warrior guy in the game, not knowing it's the handicapped kid. Anyway, at the midpoint, while online--and during a huge action / escape scene, she confesses her love for the warrior, but it all seems so hopeless since she doesn't know him in real life and her real life is so fucked,e tc. So she eats the bottle of antidepressants. The warrior / kid has to get heroic in real life and save her life, but in so doing he reveals his true identity to her.

As she recovers, they start to deal with their real-life feelings for each other. And the girl realizes how silly it is for her to try suicide when this handicapped kid is so strong despite his situation. But the dragon has now revealed that he knows the kid's real name. So the hunt is on for the dragon's real-world identity. The kid and his friend have to lure the dragon out of the game site, into a related site, where they can install a trojan to capture keystrokes and get his password. (Or something.) And there's probably a MacGuffin, some object the dragon has that would give the warrior / kid invincibility.

Anyway, upshot: kid is loving that he's winning over this girl, and he's also being stretched in real life to do things he thought were impossible, all kind of led by his quest to defeat this dragon. But at the end of the second act, as they triumph over the dragon, the kid's health really collapses. The girl also learns that his condition is ultimately fatal. They got the MacGuffin with the real-world info about the dragon's true identity (or something), but instead of going to the hospital the kid makes them chase down this guy who's behind the dragon. Big E.T.-like chase sequence, I hope. They wind up at a hospital and his mom realizes this is where the dad used to work. They go in and ask for the dad but they say there's no Doctor Whatever. But someone knows his name and says his office is down the hall. They get there, it's the janitor's closet. Inside are cleaning supplies, books about muscular dystrophy, and a computer. The kid's dad walks in and finds them all there. Turns out he became a janitor at the hospital so he could keep obsessively researching the kid's condition. But he also realized the best thing he could do would be to coach the kid--through the game--to live fully right now and conquer his fear before the disease takes him. To become fully alive before he dies, as it were. It's kind of a champagne ending, as by this time the bully has joined the team, the girl has fallen for the kid, the kid lands his dream girl, the dad redeems his mistakes, the mom softens toward the dad, and the kid overcomes his fear of both life and death. 

All the video game stuff would be shot in character, as if it were a live-action fantasy movie. So actors would play both parts: handicapped kid / strapping warrior, gothy girl / gorgeous princess, etc.

It still needs a lot of work so that the logic follows, the motivations are strong enough, etc.

I'm going for PG, somewhat Spielbergian effect. Dunno if I can achieve it but we shall see.</br></br>

I'm almost certain Jettison Charlie played with them a couple times, but I mostly remember them because they were one of a half-dozen or so Norfolk bands whose records came out on a label from there that seemed to pop up with cash one day. Antic Hay being another band on that label. Can't remember the label name though. We tried to get their attention. Pretty sure we hung out with the drummer from Buttsteak a little.

We haven't gotten as far as Googling furniture styles yet--I swear we will--but what are your thoughts on using some kind of cool reclaimed wood? There's a guitar maker here in Silver Lake who uses all kinds of crazy reclaimed woods for his guitars. They have soul. They're the opposite of some sparkly B.C. Rich piece of shit. They all have stories. Also, Alison has this corner bookshelf that her step dad made from an old oak door, and it's pretty rad.

<b> Dec 5, 2011, at 12:15 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> The "ELM" discussion could get longish.  Here are some key points:

I'm not at all interested in any kind of long-term committed relationship with a single person at this point.

I like dates.  I like getting to know new people.  I like the flirting.  When there's no chemistry, I find that interesting.  I enjoy everything about dating except spending money.

It's nice to date sans agenda.  Some of these people may become dear friends (e.g., you and Cate), some may become lovers, some may become people I roll my eyes at when I'm with my friends and I see them walking down the street.  In each case, it's interesting.  

The "ethical" piece (I hope) is that I am almost grotesquely up-front about my intentions.  I make a first pass at being truthful and disclosing about where I'm coming from.  Whether or not my date appears to have heard what I've disclosed, I tell the truth a second time.  I search my conscience for lies of omission.  If, after all that, they're game for exploring what (if anything) comes next, then usually, something comes next.  That could be sex.  It could also be going to a farmers' the following Saturday.

Please forgive the following arrogant statement: I have a brand of charm, emotional inquisitiveness, and frank sexual openness that many women seem to appreciate.  I haven't always owned this.  In fact, I used to judge this part of myself very unfavorably.  What I'm saying with this (admittedly silly) "ethical ladies' man" label is that I'm trying to find out how to live out this part of myself without also being "that guy."

I find that this approach (i.e. me being me) works especially well with women who are at least 35.  Most have been divorced and are coming to similar conclusions.

"First, do no harm" is very much on my mind.</br></br>

<b> Dec 5, 2011, at 12:31 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> I also have to be careful not to be confused with ELO though I should be so lucky as to be that talented.

Cate.  Of course I'd pursue her!.  Duh.  But there'd be problems.  I definitely don't want kids.  I'm not looking for a monogamous relationship.  And so on.  My guess is that our goals (she has 'em, I don't) might not really line up.  She sure is an amazing woman, though.  So smart, so engaged with life, so attractive.  We have been emailing back and forth at a leisurely pace.  If that continues, I will need to check in with her at some point to make sure that our correspondence is not in some way leading her on.  Because if I hurt her in any way, I know you'd deliver a severe beat down and that I'd deserve it.

Maybe I should pull together different dining room tables, make a few pdfs, and we can start there.</br></br>

I had jury duty all last week. So tedious. I tried so hard to get out of it but I was the last alternate seated and there was no one else. I need scarier metal t-shirts.

Also we lost power for a couple of days because of this insane wind storm. Like, hurricane-force winds. Trees down everywhere. Madness. Didn't stop jury duty though. It was just a civil trial -- injury at the lumberyard -- so thankfully it only lasted a week.

<b> Dec 6, 2011, at 6:32 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So I'm working on this script outline and trying to find the right setup for this plot turn. Basically, I'm trying to concoct a scenario in which a girl on antidepressants is alone at home and encounters some other substance or circumstance that endangers her. Not a suicide attempt, necessarily, but a kind of depressed recklessness that puts her in danger. 

Maybe drinks a lot of alcohol. Or leaves the iron on and something catches fire. Or does something to create dangerous fumes. Or something.

YOu know of any stories or situations that might fit the bill?</br></br>

<b> Dec 6, 2011, at 6:57 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I want enough ambiguity that we're unsure -- and maybe *she's* unsure --- if it's a genuine suicide attempt or one of those teen "fuck it" moments that leads to something really bad.</br></br>

<b> Dec 6, 2011, at 7:23 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Yeah, I hear you.

One of my guideposts is DEAD POET'S SOCIETY, when this kid finds something he really loves (acting), but his dad forbids him to be in the play, but he does it anyway, and the dad sees the play, and instead of praising his son's incredible performance, he declares he'll be sent off to military school for defying him and then to law school for a respectable career. And the kid kills himself. And it hits us really hard -- even though it's a moment of teen angsty melodrama, in a lot of ways.

The setup here is that the girls parents are rich, kinda neglect her, don't pay attention to her at all, act like everything's cheery but have her on antidepressants because she wears a lot of black, that kind of thing. And the parents are each cheating on each other without the other knowing. But the girl knows. And she's been looking forward to her big 16th birthday party and expecting some surprise. But the dad says he has to go out of town for business (the girl knows it's to meet his mistress), and seizing this chance, the mom runs off too with her lover. The mom just bolts out the door with a bag, makes some excuse, leaves the key and some money for pizza. Everyone totally forgets the birthday. So this girl is all alone in this big empty house, everyone's forgotten her big day, she's on meds and feeling melodramatic. 

I'm thinking I might just have her do something to cause a household fire and then succumb to the smoke (because then the protagonist can see from outside her house that she's in trouble). But it would be better if she takes some action (like drinking a whole bottle of liquor) that is a logical thing to do but mixes badly with her meds. DUnno, maybe THEN she could be in a stupor and start a fire. I just don't want it to be too Rube Goldberg.</br></br>

We have Alison's French friend Aymeric visiting, so there's a lot of funny
talking going on.

We also just bought a ton of books to send to my nephews and nieces in
Turkey. Kinda hard to come by good English books there, it seems.

No real news here. It rained all day. We drove by a sad deserted dog park

<b> Dec 12, 2011, at 10:34 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> So it's back on with Jill?

I really liked The Descendants too. It's one that keeps giving afterwards.
And it's funny and smart during.

I thought Jason had broken up with Katey. I'm way behind on DC gossip.

Do you ever see Eric Axelson in RVA? He just moved there.

Emily, 13.
Molly, 11.
William, 9.
Lizzie, 6.
Ruthie 2.

All ages approximate.

We got them the Lord of the Rings trilogy, A Wrinkle In Time, Watership
Down, some fairy tale books for the little ones, 1 2 3 California (a cool
learning-to-count book), The Ha-Ha Farm (animals and stuff), and a couple of
paper doll / postcard / making stuff books.

"I can't make this fucker say 'cock-a-doodle-doo!'" -- Alison, messing with
the animal book. (Not a "that's what she said" joke, unfortunately.)

</b> <br><br> I wouldn't say "it's" back on.  But something is on.  Which is terrific because I really didn't want to lose that connection.  I just didn't want a standard relationship kind of thing.  Friendship seems extremely possible and even likely.  

Yeah, The Descendants was good.  Really, really good.  It sure was weird to see Clooney dressed so poorly.

Why did Eric Axelson move to Richmond?  That seems odd.  I mean...why would anyone move here?  Staying makes a lot of sense to me, but coming here out of the blue doesn't.  I've only met that dude once.  If he's looking for new people to meet, send him my way.

Jason and Katey probably did break up for a while.  I dunno.

5 nieces and nephews in one family.  Wow.  And what an age spread.  Your sister must have her hands full.  Have you been to Turkey?  Any plans to go?

Re. Aymeric.  I don't understand.  Either he hates America or he's not French.

Speaking of the French, I had a nice lunch date with a Quebecois philosophy professor today.  She specializes in some some weird aspect of epistemology.  After everything she said, I was like, 'How do you know that?"  I don't think it got old at all.</br></br>

Chesley had been to Turkey and said it was the greatest place she'd ever been.

I'm beginning to think you hate America insofar as you're defending a French person.   What has the Left Coast done to you, Bob?  It remains un-American to enjoy anything French, like body odor.  Or sex.

Do send Eric my way.  I'm always happy to meet someone new for a beer.

Yes about Jill.  And I'm glad for it, too.

That's great about Scott.  What were the haikus?  Was each card different?

It's not yet 9, and I'm nodding off.</br></br>

<b> Dec 14, 2011, at 8:44 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Epistemology jokes! Excellent.

I want to go to Turkey and I have miles saved up that would get me to
Europe, but I'm nowhere near having the money for a stay and much
depends on Alison's sched / our finances. When I go I want to travel
around that end of the Mediterranean. I'm super stoked by the idea
though.

Aymeric has eaten at In N Out and Jack In the Box, at least, since
he's been here. I feel like that's somehow revealing.

Axelson was tired of DC. Wanted a change of scenery. He has some
friends in RVA. There's probably some deeper reason too, dunno. He's
from Fredericksburg so it probably feels more like home, in a way. He
was never really a DC type of guy, I don't think. He's a hippie (in a
good way). I love him to death. I'll send him your way.

It feels maybe not that surprising that A) Jill would kinda freak out
a little about your stance, then B) come back around after she cooled
off. So I'm glad for that.

Scott Teems sent out his Xmas cards this week and they're entirely in haiku.

Last night I went to see Mission Impossible. It was rad in that shit-blowing-up way. Dude, the scene where T. Cruise scales the outside of the highest building in the world (Dubai) with no rope just made my nuts crawl back up inside. Whoa.</br></br>

What's news? How was the 1% retreat?  The Golden Cougar?

News here:

Lousy cancer scare with my sister, but with a happy ending this time.  A gnarly-looking mass showed up in an MRI.  We had to wait and wait for the biopsy.  The predictive stats were grim.  And then it turned out to be benign.  I cannot express how much relief we all felt.

Spending lots of time with Miriam.  At this point I know better than to make any kind of predictions about long-term relationship "success" (and by long-term I mean longer than 2 months), but I'm basically falling for her.  Haven't felt like this since the first few months with Chesley.  I realize how silly it sounds to say so, but I honestly thought I was no longer capable of feeling this kind of stuff.

Also, it's totally not news, but I continue to struggle with the same irritating existential problems I've been struggling with since I was like 13.  The good news is that it feels more irritating than tragic these days.

I've not forgotten about the table.  I'm just procrastinating.</br></br>

<b> Jan 24, 2012, at 4:53 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Avast!

Man, have we not talked since New Years? Oy. The Golden Cougar was bizarre, as usual. Kind of existentially grim as well. Like watching 60 year old high school kids. We sat there drinking, listening to Billy Joel covers, and making up stories for all the rich oddballs in there. Kinda great. 

Last weekend Alison picked up an emergency shift with that same chef, this time in Palm Springs waiting on Warren Buffet and his wife--who apparently was hilarious and awesome. She was a waitress in the diner where Mr. Buffet used to eat every day. Way to go, lady.

I do not like the cancer scare. 

Though maybe there's a Mitchell & Webb gag in there somewhere, where someone delivers "cancerous" x-rays to a friend for the effect of sudden elation when they're revealed to be fake. 

Or maybe not.

I'm happy to hear that about Miriam, you grim fucker. Always prognosticating doom, and shit. Yes, life is dark and wearisome, but also there are girls!

No pressure about the table. We're not in a hurry.

The movie that Alison's boss is about to do (which may take us to Atlanta for a couple months) involves Jason Bateman's identity being stolen by Melissa McCarthy. The script (the parts I've heard) are so fucking hilarious.

Did you know that Bobby Donne co-wrote a movie that's in Sundance right now? It also stars Tim from Tim & Eric, though evidently not doing his character.</br></br>

Yeah, Bobby co-wrote Rick's new movie.  That's the one I told you about where after the screening Collee told Rick that more than anything, it just made her uncomfortable and he said, "Good."

2.  Since Saturday I have been the sickest I've ever been in my life.  Scary sick.  Physically, not crazy-wise.  Nasty infection in throat.  [Insert blowjob joke here.]

3.  I'm a bit buzzed on Percocet and have in mind that you were directing that life metaphor post directly at me because you are so enraged that I posted those cute dog videos on your FB page thinking I was continuing to poke fun at how much you love dogs which is pretty much what I was doing only I think it's completely lovely how much you love dogs and I love them that much too and like you I can't have a dog where I live so sometimes video is all I can manage so in addition to poking fun at your somewhat frequent cute dog posts I was also posting those particular cute dog posts because they were so cute.

4. I may watch another movie.  Should it be "Horrible Bosses?"  Just looking for not-terrible.  Anything better than that would be a bonus.</br></br>

<b> Mar 8, 2012, at 12:55 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hey, random question. Do you know Tommy Van Auken? He's a painter in
RVA. I knew him a little before I left. Even then he was doing great
work. I'm looking at some of his recent work and some of it I find
compelling but other stuff I can't get into. It's hard for me to put a
finger on. I'm mostly not that into anything of his that's even a
little landscapey. But I love his portraits of women. And his less
figurative / more impressionistic stuff.

https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eric-Schindler-Gallery/119667029464?sk=info

If I ever had any money I'd think about scoring some of his work. But
in my current fantasy football version of art buying, I can't decide
what I'd go for.</br></br>

<b> Mar 8, 2012, at 2:14 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Naptime is over?

Once upon a time, I befriended this woman Susan (who later appeared in
the Nitrate Hymnal). She's really beautiful and very laid back.
Naturally, I asked her out. When we were deciding what to do I
suggested this art opening at a space called Signal 66. I didn't know
much about the art but all their shows were really cool events. So we
agreed to meet there. Day of, I got there a little early. I strolled
around looking at the art. There were two photographers with work
hanging. One did portraits of Burmese teenagers who were guerrilla
soldiers. The other did huge 8-foot nudes of women. (You see where
this is headed.) I walked around looking at them all and the very last
one was Susan. Whoa. Little butterfly tattoo on her hip. Hot body.
Etc.

She did not show up for the date. Ha ha.

Post script: I told her about this years later and she didn't remember
it. I'm not sure if I believe her.

Dear Friends,

As you know, we’ve been funding the majority of our programming this year through our quasi-legal DIY LASIK surgery clinics. However, due to recent changes in California state law, we have been forced to find more traditional (and less medically invasive) methods of fundraising. To that end we have launched a kickstarter campaign whose proceeds will be used to transform Machine Project into a transdimensional hallway.

The Hallway will act as a theater set for Asher Hartman's See What Love The Father Has Given Us : a religio-dramedy about three big box store employees who travel through tiers of reality taking on aspects of the Holy Trinity. Each performance will be limited to an intimate audience of twelve who'll be immersed in scenarios which may include: Professional Amateurism, Alien Ass Cannons, Non-Threatening Muzak, Interplanetary Love and 19th Century special effects. As with past performances we've done with Asher, we expect this show to sell out very quickly due to an extremely limited number of seats. Pledges of $40 or more will guarantee admission to the play before tickets are released to the general public on Tuesday, March 27th.

In additional to this remarkable production the transdimensional hallway will be host to a number of events responding to the parameters of the space, including an immersive and interactive sound piece by Emily Lacy, a musical performance by Claire Cronin and a lecture about the Winchester Mystery House by Colin Dickey.

Pledges can be made here:http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/machineproject/transdimensional-hallway

love,
Machine

My impulse after the Catholicism bit is to add something like: "Which may have been his plan all along." (Even though that's not true. It just amuses me.)

I think "steaming heap of mediocrity" is too thick. You need something more bland-sounding. 

Nice parens.

Aaaaaand the final line is the awesome kicker.

<b> Mar 20, 2012, at 4:52 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> …on fire, yes.

Okay, so, through a friend I got this gig writing a pilot for a new Spike show, working title "Urban Jungle Man." (Idiotic title.) It's based on a real guy who goes by Urban Tarzan, or just Tarzan. He looks like Fabio, hails from New Jersey, and wrangles exotic animals who get loose or are abandoned. We're making a show where he has to subdue like four dangerous animals per show, plus gets into fistfights, and occasionally encounters hot chicks.

It is an education, I can assure you.

Please enjoy the following notes from a studio exec. The context doesn't matter…

BEAVER IS NEVER GOING TO CHEW THE POLE, WHICH IS USUALLY METAL. SHOULD BE A MILF NOT A POOL BOY. MAYBE IN SOMETHING SEXY.

<b> Apr 11, 2012, at 2:17 PM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> That is very helpful.  Thank you.

Altering the voice is so difficult for me.  I'd like to be able to do that.

Questions to clarify:

1. When you say I should use a numbered list, do you mean (A) a different list than the extant one or (B) that I should add (probably fake (ha!)) data to the existing points?

I'd just rework the existing points in terms of (possibly fake) stats. Like, instead of "Poetry has the highest mortality rate of any profession," use a %. "Poetry has a 97.5% mortality rate; more than any other profession." (Although I don't understand what this point means at all.) Alt: Lowest job satisfaction, after classical musicians and rotorooters.


2. If you mean (A) should the existing points be combined into the screed?

Nah, I think the first four points speak for themselves. The fifth point should be where this "objective" piece rides off the rails. So maybe you want to order the first four so that they're increasingly insane sounding, a slow build toward the final reveal that you are actually a frustrated and possibly absinthe-addled poet who just got snubbed at a cocktail party and this is the rebuttal you should have given an hour ago while the pretty woman was still giving you, the poet, the time of day. Which time of day you'd hoped would lead to pussy.


3. What do I need to do to indicate that the story about the cocktail party is autobiographical?  I like that idea, but how do I add it?  I mean, can it be done in a sentence or two or is it a matter of rewriting?

You basically do it already. Start very general and non-specific and then with each sentence get more painfully, eye-poppingly specific, inadvertently revealing your attempt to address these buffoons and philistines -- which you the writer completely don't realize is awkward and possibly psychotic.</br></br>

<b> Apr 11, 2012, at 5:05 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Okay, thoughts:

Great idea for a McSweeneys piece. Right up their alley, subject-wise.

McSweeneys has a particular voice. Wry, faux-earnest, big left-turn zinger, and so on. I think you should adopt this voice. You're in the ballpark, structurally, but the voice goes a long way, I think.

I think you should use a numbered list for this. I think the first four should be short, clear, indisputable statistical facts about famous poet poverty and mortality and such. Really short, really dry, but interesting (and possibly all made up). Drop some names. The fifth should be your screed, which starts out semi-sane but then is gradually understood to be wholly and awkwardly autobiographical.

This is my $0.02. Feel free to drop it on the sidewalk, as I often do with that amount.

They will totally publish some shit from you. This will happen.</br></br>

I think this version is definitely stronger and funnier. Here's the thing: the first four are things everyone already knows. So just state them in one sentence. Very dry, very obvious, maybe a footnoted citation here and there. Brevity being the soul of wit, just make them short. 

THEN

That fifth one will really be an eye-opener. 

I think there's a problem with using the second person. Maybe if you used "one" and "the poet" instead of "you?" For example: "Should one become a poet, people at cocktail parties will ask The Poet what The Poet does for a living. When The Poet says, "Oh, I'm a poet," pretty much everyone will reply, "Me too."</br></br>

Five Reasons Not to Become a Poet
By Timothy McCready
804-357-2111
takethefirstleft@gmail.com

There are many good reasons not to become a poet.  Here are five of them:

1)  Poets have a 98% self-inflicted mortality rate--higher than any other
professional group including dentists, Japanese middle managers, and orchestra
bassoonists.

2)  The handful of poets who don't annihilate themselves are usually more
insane than not; it's unclear whether they start off sane before poetry drives
them crazy or if they start out insane in the first place.

3)  Poets are almost always forced to work as adjunct faculty paid low hourly
rates in English departments at second-tier colleges, teaching 17- and
18-year-olds how to read.

4)  Poets' work is normally only appreciated by other poets, so the fan base
is miniscule to begin with, not to mention mostly insane or dead from suicide.
If they're not insane or dead, other poets will very likely make snarky
comments to each other about your work--even if they secretly like it--in the
unlikely event that you ever manage to get any of it published.  These kinds
of conversations can often be accidentally overheard in the dilapidated break
areas (with their stale air that reeks of mold and despondency) that are set
aside for low-paid adjuncts at second-tier college English departments.

5) When you’re a poet, people at cocktail parties ask what you do for a
living.  When you say,"Oh, I'm a poet," pretty much everyone replies, "Me,
too,” and then they want to recite some of their poetry for you.  You try not
to grimace at the prospect. You try to refrain from laughing scornfully during
the earnest recitations of these goons’ ham-handed, mawkish nonsense.  Once
they've finished, you do your best to respond politely, smiling in a way that
you hope conveys approval--or at least mild interest--but despite your efforts
you watch it register on their faces that you have found their verse lacking.
The mood quickly shifts, and they icily request that you recite something of
yours.  You want to explain that there's a certain opacity to your work that
may not translate in the present setting (read “among you boorish
philistines”), but saying anything of the sort would only make you seem more
insufferable than you already do, and anyway, the gathering crowd insists.
They have the same looks on their faces that the Romans had at a crucifixion.
You desperately search the mental fireplace in which you long ago incinerated
your "early work" for the most accessible thing you've ever written.  You
settle on something that any idiot--even these idiots--could appreciate.
Drawing yourself to your full height, you recite the poem, which probably
sounds something like this:

His blank wings and crown,
Trident-sceptered and lost,
Moments before the gloaming and spread
of shadow on the concrete
and the stone
as well as some rocks,
and also very fine gravel,
and probably some sand, too.

Your audience has no idea that you've finished.  When you fail to continue,
they probably assume you've had a stroke.  You have no choice but to shake
your jazz hands and jocularly say something like, "That's all folks," at which
point your audience realizes that their stunned silence may have made them
look like hicks who don't know when a poem is over.  That's when the host, a
silver-haired professor of cardiac surgery, who was recently profiled in “The
Times Magazine” steps in and says, "Well, that's just great.  Just terrific.
Good job.  Keep at it."  The crowd disperses, eyebrows raised in that way that
can only mean, “What an alienating, pretentious waste of oxygen.”

On the walk home, every bus that passes and every bridge you cross presents an
almost inexorable temptation to complete your destiny.</br></br>

<b> Apr 23, 2012, at 6:38 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Thinking...

I didn't actually laugh out loud, although I thought it was amusing in general. Perhaps that's a function of the construction? I think I had to re-read a couple of sentences. Humor is a function of surprise, so the shorter the sentences, the easier it is to be surprised -- is my humble opinion. 

Okay, riffing on that, a couple of suggestions:

I'd just plainly state, "Your foot is a 9/12. I have this app on my phone..."

Stuff like "such romance as to take my breath away" would be funny in another context but it doesn't sound like something someone would say in a missed connections ad. If you replaced the foot with someone's face (which is the normal circumstance), how would your ad read? those things tend to be kind of shy and understated. Which i think would go well as a contrast to your outrageous conceit.

I like the precise measurements and the toe polish thing.

Little Five Points sounds pretty dreary.  What's the name of the main rock club there?  The Alligator or something?

I once played a show at a lesbian fern bar in Atlanta.  We were opening for a lesbian band with a dedicated lesbian following.  Rarely have I felt so self-conscious about owning a penis.  It ended up being a fun show.

Then I ate a huge serving of lebanese.  And so on.

How long has it been since India died?  10 years?  Sad.

<b> Apr 27, 2012, at 10:12 AM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> I like this. In a weird way this one feels maybe the most Mcsweeeysish of them all so far. But then again it's been established that I don't know what's what with that outfit.

Hotlanta is interesting. I've wandered around a little while Alison's at work. Funny thing: went to Little Five Points, which would be the neighborhood equivalent of Grace Street near Twisters (back in the day), with head shops and tattoo places, etc., thinking I'd find something there to do or see. And I was just so bummed by it. It felt like all these people trying too hard, being conspicuously down and out. So that was interesting.

I left there and went to the neo-yuppie neighborhood to buy fancy coffee. 

Had a couple of flashbacks about India Stanley. Which is always weird.

I think tonight I'll get to watch some actual filming and maybe meet Melissa McCarthy if I'm lucky.

What's the haps there?

<b> May 9, 2012, at 3:24 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Okay, sorry, been kinda swamped.

First thought: the worst possible thing is to seem maudlin. So if you want to make this point, I'd find a way to give it a little ironic twist to add some distance. Everyone has thought "I'm a loser," but it's embarrassing when someone else says "I'm a loser." 

Also, it's not factually accurate to say that you, Timothy McCready, are a loser. I have met losers and you fail miserably at that. So this isn't memoir material either.

Therefore I read it as fiction. 

I might consider coming up with some absurd term to replace "loser." Something kind of funny and jaunty. Turn it on its head. Like: "I was almost 40 before I realized that I was--and always have been--a Nice Guy / Shlemiel / Weisenheimer / Friendboy / whatever."

Same thing for "winner." 

I think this needs some narrative arc. All the observations are funny and good but it needs a beginning / middle / end, with some surprising twist or payoff. 

Or, if you're going the McSweeneys route, it could be a bulet-pointed list. Or a diagram, How To Tell If You're A [Loser / Nice Guy / etc.]

It might be fun to have two characters, one who's the obnoxious Winner and the other who's the awesome, cool, rad quote-unquote Loser.

But basically, this is all good data that needs some kind of compelling shape.</br></br>

The more abstract and dark they get, the funnier it seems to me. Sometimes they do stuff that's kinda like Numberwang, like media commentary bits...meta comedy...blah blah blah. But it's never gross or scary like Tim and Eric.

<b> May 15, 2012, at 10:11 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So I met Jason Bateman yesterday.</br></br>

<b> May 15, 2012, at 10:45 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Well, I went to the set yesterday, which was in an office building not far from where we're staying. I like hanging around and watching, when I can. It's an amazing process. But so the best spot to stand is near what's called the "video village," which is where they have monitors set up for the producers and director and others to see how the shot looks. Bateman's chair was there. Basically, it was between set ups and I was just standing there with Mo, and Bateman's standing around waiting for the next scene to be set up, and he just sticks out his hand and says, "Hi, I'm Jason." So I say hi and that I come with Alison. And she says I'm her husband. And Bateman goes on about, Oh, you're very lucky you know, there's a long line of people in love with her, the transpo guys mostly, but also catering I think. And I'm all like, Yeah, I know I'm lucky, I've heard. Alison's had a few conversations with him. He seems very unpretentious, just hangs around and chats with people, very nice. And of course, he has that French bulldog, Hank.

Melissa McCarthy is also super nice, I'm told, and evidently curious to meet me because she likes Alison. 

Amanda Peet, it turns out, is more than a tad frosty.</br></br>

<b> May 15, 2012, at 11:31 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I guess she made sort of a poor impression on people because she was somewhat difficult and also not a very good actor.

Sounds like she could use a good rogering.</br></br>

I guess it's dumb to use "Best Picture" as a metric for what's good in a movie.  And once art is like professional or whatever, it doesn't make much sense to put it into competition.  But damn.  That was one of the best movies I've seen in years.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Ah yes, the haps.  What is the haps?  Are the haps?  What be the haps?

Kind of down a deep hole of jagged, weird insanity.  Waiting for a medicine change to take hold.  It's bad enough to negatively affect every domain of my life, but I'm practiced enough now to resist it with at least intermittent success.

On my 3rd or 4th go 'round with Arrested Development, and it's no less funny.  Miriam had not seen it, so it's fun to watch it with her.

Speaking of Miriam, I'm going to Montreal one month from today.  Had to get a new passport; can you believe that it came in the mail two weeks after I submitted my application?  That seems fast.  It'll be good to get out of town. 

Am dog sitting for a friend of a friend.  Three dogs.  One of them, some kind of minuscule terrier, is 15 years old.  He has the worst breath I've ever smelled.  In fact, if you notice a bad smell wherever you are, it's probably this dog's breath.

What about you?  What is be are the haps there?</br></br>

<b> Jul 21, 2012, at 5:28 AM / Timothy McCready / </b> <br><br> Glib/Sarcastic Version: Oh you know.  Fine, fine.  Like, whatever.  It's AWESOME.

Real Version: It's complicated.  On the one hand, I just got home from a week in Montreal with Miriam that also included time at her lake shack north of the city.  The trip was good, as is the relationship with Miriam.  Actually, we're calling it a "relationship workshop" because we both require a certain kind of self-consciousness and meta-relating, having chosen one person after another who weren't good for us.  This is definitely the best domain of my life these days.  That and friends.  And their dogs.

But.  I've also been going through another bout of torture for a couple of months.  It comes and goes.  It has to do with stuff in the McCready household in the 70s.  I thought I'd worked through most of this.  Maybe I have.  But when I moved back to Richmond in 2005, it was clear to me and Jean that there was some stuff we hadn't been able to address.  Sexual violence.  I just let that sleeping dog lie.  It started growling a couple of months ago and then barking and biting.  Basically, I go into a kind of trance state in which my body reacts as though the nightmare is happening in the present.  It's destabilizing as hell.  I'm living with a more or less constant, intense drive towards suicide.  I can switch from normal me to totally-lost me at the drop of a hat.  So, it blows.  I'm sick of this garbage.  

At the moment though, I'm basically fine.  I need more of a plan for the day, though.  Letting some friends' dogs out later.  That'll be good.

Thanks for checking in.

Please tell me what's up with you and your lady.  Why don't you two get a dog that I can love vicariously?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> In all seriousness, I think every relationship is a "relationship workshop." It's pretty great that it's just out there though. I would think that makes everything way more manageable, emotionally.

That FB photo of you with the eye-rolling dog was pretty world class.

I'm sorry to hear about the bubbling chaos. It's a fucking crime and you deserve better. 

Just out of curiosity, do you work out in any way? I notice a relationship between my physical exertion and mental state. I'm sure this is not news or anything, I was just wondering.

As for dogs, the dog-centric discussions are ramping up. Our landlady is the main obstacle. That and the issue of future out-of-town productions (manageable, I think, but needs some research). We're big dog whores. (Okay, I am. But she's an enabler.) You will be considered Uncle Tim when the day comes.

Me: got some rare good news. This TV pilot / pitch I did about the French Foreign Legion just attached Akiva Goldsman (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326040/) as a producer. And maybe director, if things go well. He's a big name. So this opens a lot of doors. It's a long way from being sold yet but this is real currency in Hollywood.

The lady is doing well. She has to drive across town every day to do post-production stuff on ID THEFT. But we're stoked to be back in L.A.

Speaking of which! Mike Halverson and Caroline said they're going to move here. I AM SO STOKED. They're tired of the NYC hassle. I'm gonna try to con them into living in our neighborhood. Then maybe I'll start working on you.</br></br>

That is extremely good news about Mike and Caroline.  Also great news about the TV pilot.  Please keep me posted on both accounts as well as any dog developments.

I swam from an island in the lake back to shore today.  I'd rowed out there while other people swam.  To your question: No, I don't exercise as much as I should.  So when I do something like that I really feel it.

Soul murder / extinguishing of hope in a human being. 

Fuck. I'll either get through the last of it this time or I won't.

I've been thinking a lot about issues of inhabiting the body lately. And/or dissociation. I think I have a mild problem with that. I finally cracked a book my one and only therapist gave me circa 2005 called "Parenting From the Inside Out." She recommended it not for the parenting so much as for the neurobiological explanations of how our brains are formed and emotions are shaped, and how that affects both our own childhood and the behavior patterns we can inherit from parents. We'll see how it is.

In unrelated news, this amused me / freaked me out today:

I'm in the midst of an island of sanity, thanks be to god. It's like a furlough from jail or something. 

Dude. The neurobiology of emotion is fascinating apart from one's personal issues. I have lots of armchair theories about that, most of which boil down to: An excess of stress hormones (especially cortisol) causes brain damage, especially to the hippocampus and limbic system, and this damage is worse when chronic or when in younger kids. 

Anyway. 

What's up with you these days?  Any news re. the French foreign legion?

While I know your temper has posed problems for you, I envy it nonetheless. Being a gentle, charming type is total horse shit. The anger's still there, just inside and self-directed. 

As close to the edge of oblivion as I've ever been. Not sure I'll make it. But I'll make it through today. 

The stuff you said altered your wiring. What were you talking about re. HIV?

Today I am drinking and drugging to get through. Keeping track of what's taken when. Not trying to make it all worse. Just fooling my brain, distracting it.

I didn't go to Montreal after all.  It's a hell of a drive for a short amount of time, and I thought I could probably line up enough stuff here to keep myself reasonably sane.  Seeing "Argo"  today with my sister.  Will probably go to the dog park with Helen at some point over the next couple of days.

Watched "Damsels in Distress" last night.  That was one weird movie.  I liked it pretty well, but it had this confusing smooth jazz soundtrack .

If you're lucid enough to tell me what's been going on, please do.

My life feels an awful lot like Memento.  So many puzzling gaps in memory, often beginning right as bad shit was about to happen.  I'm mostly focused on life at Eastern Shore Chapel in the 70s and early 80s.  At mass on Easter of 2002, I went into a kind of trance during which the face of my childhood choir director, J. Justice, took up most of my consciousness, saying "If you tell them, I will kill you" in a voice 3 or 4 octaves below what you'd expect in reality.  Weirdly, despite being in intense therapy at the time, I didn't make all that much of it.  Jean did, of course.  I guess I wasn't ready.

I've done so much heavy lifting on how bad it was in the McCready home.  There's more of that work to be done, I'm afraid.  But since June, I've been mostly trying to understand the memories and dreams and compulsions that powerfully suggest that I began having forced sexual contact with a man (or men) somewhere around mid-1976.  Many of these feelings and thoughts are associated with church.  The stuff I've done in art therapy over the past decade regularly comes back to Episcopalian themes.

Eastern Shore Chapel was so bizarre, Bob.  Many Sundays, after Sunday school and the 11 o'clock service, there'd be a parish picnic.  These featured amazing amounts of boozing.  The adults would all get really fucked up.  The kids would get really bored.  Thing is, there was also a pervasive atmosphere of swinging.  These picnics were like preludes to key parties or something.  Overt, drunk, libertine sexuality with the kids around.  It's a predator's ideal hunting ground.

As I've been feeling my way through this, I've wanted to find a confederate who was older than me, still attached to the Episcopal Church, and who I could risk trusting.  I found such a person in Keith Owen, pastor of an Episcopal parish in Ohio.  I chose him to reach out to because he's learning Arabic and is involved in Palestinian justice; he seems to care about the marginalized.  We spoke last week.  He grew up at ESC and thinks of it fondly as his spiritual home.  Yet he readily admitted that the atmosphere when he returned from college in '82 was "drunk, swingerish, and weird."  Also, after he heard my story (and Julie's) he told me he wants to get to the bottom of what happened in that time and place at any cost.  He said that if there was justice to be found, he'd help find it.  He said that while nothing he or the church can do can make my past okay, he would hope that some kind of restitution might help and that he thought that could be possible depending on what turns up.

So far he's talked to the parish's current interim rector, Jim Sell, who has learned all about that era's culture, though he was nowhere near it.  Keith plans to talk to Ed Brown, the current senior warden of the parish vestry.  Apparently, Ed left ESC in the late 70s because it had gotten "weird."  Ed's gay.  Imagine how marginalized a gay man in Virginia Beach at that time might have felt.  How weird would "weird" have to be in order for him to bail on a community that had nurtured him in some ways?

The rector at the time, Charlie Riddle, was a terrible alcoholic who is rumored to have had affairs with parishioners.  I'm almost certain one of them was my mother; I remember him coming over in the middle of the day when my father wasn't there.  In fact, once I smeared my feces all over the bathroom mirror because I objected to his presence.  I was maybe 4.  Later, at my mother's 40th birthday party, he gave her a book called "Small Breasted Women Have Bigger Hearts."

This morning I was remembering a party at a parishioner's house that featured naked lady lollipops.  Possibly penis pops, too, but I'd have to ask Julie.  In any case, you probably get the picture.

I don't know man.  I'm trying not to draw conclusions too soon, but something about all of this stinks A LOT.  Even if there's no conclusive evidence that J. Justice was abusing kids in the choir, something about this parish is both fascinating as a window into that era and totally horrific.</br></br>

<b> Nov 6, 2012, at 7:58 PM / Bob Massey / </b> <br><br> Hey. Got antibiotics. Soooooooo much better now. It was some weird stomach bug. 

Reading all this, my reaction was: there is no way this isn't real. I mean, kids misinterpret things and as adults we misremember, but this is just too much data. 

If your mom is anything like mine, she'll deny it all to the hilt, at least for the first while. But once it's out there, it can't be swept under the rug anymore. Even if she won't confront it head-on, she won't be able to forget that you know something was amiss. Hopefully, with time, she'll be able to talk about it.

Man. What a weird time that was. There is no way to articulate how hard it sucks that you were a victim of it. I get angry every time I think about that era's parents' abdication of basic sense. Even my square-ass parents weren't immune.

As for me, just mostly in a holding pattern with writing stuff. There's been a lot of foot dragging from this showrunner guy that Seth wanted to bring onboard. We just set a deadline of Monday for an answer. After that we'll yank it from Seth and go to Akiva Goldsman, with whose company we'll pitch to cable networks. What a disappointment this whole Sony thing has been. Ridiculous. Even Seth says so.

But I'm kind of okay with it. I'd rather pitch this to cable. I think that's where it belongs.

Otherwise, not a lot going on. Our Subaru died and I sold my van, so we had to scramble to buy a used Mazda. Man, I hate doing adult shit like that. Stressful. Plus it ate our savings. But at least we had savings. That's what you have savings for, so I guess it works out.

Mike Halverson just arrived -- almost. His van died at the CA border and he's crashing with his aunt in Riverside (deep Republican O.C.). He should be installed here in L.A. in a few days though. We are so stoked.

There's a lot of great stuff in it but it mostly captures him working on abstracts. At 1:24:00 he just starts painting a new one, then a second. It's so crazy.

Funny about Loincloth. How was that?

It seems likely that I'll move into Miriam's house between January and July. That's not a great option, but it's the best of the not great options. She's putting the house on the market late spring, thus the move-out date.  I'm genuinely heartbroken about leaving this apartment; I had hoped to stay here for the rest of my life. Cheap, nice, great neighborhood. In a way, though, it'll be easier when I make a clean break from it.

Thank you and Alison so much for the Amtrak gift certificate.  That has been very, very helpful.  I can't remember whether I've said that already, but if so, I'm saying it again.

I am working with a law firm in Oregon to make a complaint against the church where I grew up.  These are the lawyers who compelled the Boy Scouts to release a bunch of documents a couple of months ago--I think the LA Times did pretty extensive coverage.  Anyway, they're working on my case with a former assistant AG in northern Virginia.  Right now they're working through some complicated shit having to do with the statute of limitations in this kind of complaint, but those issues seem surmountable.  We expect the initial complaint to land at the church's doorstep during the first couple of weeks in March.  At that point, one of two things will happen.  They'll either cry "uncle" and begin negotiating a settlement, or they'll tell us to drop dead and we'll sue.  I hope it goes the former way. If it goes the latter, it'll be a couple of years before it's resolved.

I want the church to have to admit to me that it fucked up and contributed mightily to my chronic mental health problems.  I also want them to compensate me (to whatever extent that's possible) for my losses so that I can have at least some stability in my life.  It seems likely that I'll be dealing with this bullshit one way or the other for the duration.

Therapy and the like remains the primary focus of life these days.

Although, Miriam and I have been watching "Peep Show" straight through, so that's been fun.  I feel such a sense of camaraderie with David Mitchell's inner voice.

I go to the dog park a lot these days.  Dogs are the single thing that I can count on to make me feel something like joy.  The one thing I'm positive I want in life is a dog.  So I'm working towards that a bit.  

Miriam is well.  Our relationship has settled into an interesting dynamic.  She's way more whole than I am, but not without some significant wounds.  It seems like we're loving each other in ways that we've not been loved.  I had to stop having any kind of sexual intimacy several months back because it was so frightening and triggering.  So it's been interesting to see what's there when that part isn't.  Mostly, it's very sweet.

That's all I know.

How are you?  How is Alison?  What is news?</br></br>

Got Fuzzy from a shelter last Saturday. He's probably a bit less than a year old. He weighs 10 lbs. Looks like a poodle/jack russell mix. He's pretty awesome. Both playful and snugly.  He has a mohawk of a different kind of fur from the rest of his curly coat.

Fuzzy is in deep slumber on my lap. He went to small dog daycare today so I could go to DC for therapy.  He just farted. First fart of his I've heard. But not the first I've smelled.

</b> <br><br> HA! I have in fact called him something similar: Das Füz!

He's a magnificent creature. He's affectionate, goofy, playful, and smart. (I almost wrote "very smart.") I've taught him to sit, shake, and fetch. I am dictating this email to him, in fact. He's typing it into my phone.  When he's asleep, he's so deeply asleep that you could tattoo the inside of his upright ear and he probably wouldn't notice.</br></br>

We just picked it up in the bookstore and started laughing, then both immediately were like: TIM.

I'm particularly fond of the list of weird dog names in the front. Which seems completely out of place, and yet not.

What's up?

I am: trying to work on this Mars film treatment thingy and also waiting for my manager to call me back. I procrastinated by cutting and framing a Tsunami poster that this guy Greg gave me. I met him here and it turned out he was in that band Rachels and also knew the other Tsunamis.</br></br>

<b> Feb 6, 2013, at 8:17 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Sorry, I always forget who I'm caught up with on this stuff and who I'm not. Basically, in November I had lunch with a guy I know who's a development exec for Roland Emmerich (2012, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, INDEPENDENCE DAY, etc.). This guy Aaron has good taste though. He liked this Legion TV pilot of mine and said I should come pitch on this idea they optioned. It was a crazy UFO conspiracy lady doing an interview for her blog with a guy who claimed to have been an astronaut on a private mission to Mars, and now he was back but on the run from his employers. Turned out the "astronaut" was some writer basically punking this batty woman. Anyway, I pitched my take on it and they liked it. They also liked that I'm not in the guild and thus cheap. They hired me to write a treatment (at non-guild rates) over the holidays, wiht the understanding that if Roland liked it, they'd hire me to write the script (at guild rates, which are considerable). We met several times and I did a couple versions of the treatment, which they liked, but then they decided they wanted something a little darker and asked me to try it. So right now I'm trying to figure out how to give them what they (now) want. I've already been paid all they owe me, and they were super gracious about asking me to do another pass for free--especially since they signed off on the previous passes--but I'm doing it because it's good form and I like them and it behooves all of us to nail this.

But I'm kinda having a hard time with it.

People post all these great sweet thoughtful Vonnegut quotes on FB, which makes me want to read him. I read "Slaughterhouse Five" at some distant point in the past but I barely remember it. I suspect I'd really love his sensibilities.

I have to watch this new show on Netflix called "House of Cards," which is set in DC politics and stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. It's pretty good. I have a meeting with one of the producers tomorrow. He's interested in this "Legion" pilot. It's kind of a weird gig that watching TV is mandatory. I have to convince myself that I'm not just screwing off. Though I guess I'd rather watch TV than map out storylines.

What are the leading nicknames for Fuzzy thus far?</br></br>

<b> Feb 6, 2013, at 8:41 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> "Very" is writer code for irony. No good writer would use it otherwise. (Except, you know, in email and stuff.) So it makes me laugh before I even finish the sentence. 

Weird how far ahead of, like, DFW and Dave Eggers, et al, the guy was on that.

I am now suggesting the nickname, "Füz." Kinda pronounced like "foosball" or Tobias Fünke.</br></br>

I decided to kill myself a couple of weeks ago. It was more serious than it ever had been, which was plenty.  I was aware that I loved and was loved and that my demise would cause an incredible amount of pain. But I decided to prioritize the elimination of my own torment. This doesn't say anything good about me, obviously. 

I wrote a note, a will, and instructions to whoever entered my apartment first. I took the Dramamine that was the first part of the plan and set a timer to tell me when to take the second step.

When the timer went off I was desperate to take the second step (there were supposed to be three), but goddamnit I just couldn't fucking do it. You know why?!  BECAUSE I WAS TOO FUCKING SCARED!  Scared in the same way one feels before jumping off the high dive for the first time.  Suicide is scary. 

All I have felt since is disappointment in myself. I want to get the fuck outta this torment. 

But if I can't kill myself, then I guess I'm marooned here until god in his infinite mercy sees fit to run me the fuck over with a bus.  So I might as well continue doing the shit they think will help although it seldom does. 

Thus the upcoming trip to the trauma disorders program at Sheppard Pratt.

</b> <br><br> I thought MT was a dick back then. But I was undoubtedly the dick because I was 20 and thought my band was super important and so on. 

I'm about to watch "Veep" starring Buster.  Fuzzy attacked a much larger dog in Video Fan just now.  That was a first. I think being on leash makes him more aggressive. The owner was gracious, happily. 

Did you start a shit garden?  It's a perennial. 

Once Fuzzy stood on his hind legs and braced himself with a front paw on a Great Dane's flank so he could get up high enough to smell its butt. This lasted for several seconds. Lots of dog park laughs at that stunt. 

Richmond is very beautiful in the spring, but it looks to me like a Viewmaster slide so I avert my gaze. 

Thank you for asking me if I need help with anything. Apart from communication and whatnot, I don't think so.</br></br>

<b> Apr 15, 2013, at 6:41 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Nothing dramatic to report. We're planting a garden in our little yard. Crazy, eh? 

Yesterday though we did go to this BBQ thrown by Chris Murphy for RVA expats in L.A. Mike Halverson went with us too. It wasn't that many people -- lots flaked, which is the Richmond way -- but it was fun. Did you know Chris? Sweet longhaired guy, played guitar in Pumphouse, then went on to do sound and recording for King Crimson for many years. Now owns a studio here. Also saw Annie Adchavanich, whom I mostly know from DC; Colette Miller, who was the original Gwar dancer, now a visual artist; Greg Escalante, who's Annie's boyfriend and a gallery owner here; and Chris's girlfriend Liz, a former record exec. This guy Mark Avery, who once ran the Hole In the Wall, was gonna come but got rear-ended on the way. And Mark Thomasson flaked out completely. Which is a bummer since all of us had so many Mark Thomasson stories. My favorite was Mike recalling how at the first Jesus Lizard show at Rockitz, Mark tried to hold a towel in front of David Yow's naked junk so as to avoid legal issues.

My former roommate Eric moved in next door which means that we have more access to his dog Captain -- the Best Dog In the World.™

You are back with Fuzzy?</br></br>

<b> Apr 15, 2013, at 7:06 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> When Mark Thomasson befriended me on FB my response to him was: "Hey Mark, I'm finally old enough to drink!" I don't think he really got it. But I spent like five years on the curb outside Rockitz trying to talk him into letting me in. He'd always ask me, "Aren't you 21 yet?" 

He does PR for film studios now, which seems like a graceful transition from the no-doubt thankless job of booking a shitty rock club. 

Have we talked about this? There's this theory that dogs think they're the size of whatever dog they see in front of them. Which helps explain why little dogs will try to kick the shit out of big dogs who approach them. They don't realize they're tiny. 

I have my window open and our garden smells like shit. Unsurprisingly.

What kind of job are you looking for?

The latter is the portrait of a woman barely hanging onto her sanity, but it's rendered with love, so it's a little wrenching but ultimately hopeful. It wrecks me a little. It's kinda the genesis of me (stupidly) naming my band after Gena Rowlands because in that movie she reminds me so much of my mom.</br></br>

Tom Waits w/ The Rolling Stones (via Rolling Stones Facebook)
The Rolling Stones are currently on a North American tour which brought them to Oakland last night (5/5) for a show at Oracle Arena. They played a bunch of the usual favorites like "Tumbling Dice," "Get Off of My Cloud," "Miss You," "Jumpin' Jack Flash," and so on. But most excitingly, on their version of the blues staple "Little Red Rooster," they brought out another blues-lover, Tom Waits, to help them perform it. Check out a video of that performance and the setlist from last night below.

Is that story true? That's an amazing story. It seems like they hit it off pretty hard since Keith has been on several records now. And kinda sounds great singing with Tom -- which negates my earlier theory. 

I think Mick embodies everything I despise about the spiritual state of popular music circa now. But the Stones enable it. They're a multinational corporation who assumes the most superficial characteristics of a rock band. Once they were vital but now they're boring as dirt and just as predictable.</br></br>

Today's news: an adorable Boston Terrier has moved in next door. Incentive to meet the neighbors.

I think it's so funny that Fuzzy enjoys the training. What does that say about dogs? 

Re Simple Men: dude, tell me about it. I guess it's different now that I'm immersed in commercial filmmaking but sometimes I wonder what led me to get so into some of the things I used to love as a youth. Sometimes they hold up, sometimes not so much. But I've been suggesting things Alison should see because they're landmarks of some sort, so we're going through that list. The results are interesting. Have you ever watched Chariots of Fire? I hadn't but everyone always raved about it. That shit was so slow we were both bored. It's supposed to be inspirational! Boooooooring.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> I hope that the next time Alison farts you note that it smells "unbalanced."

I also watched Metropolitan recently.  It held up better, but I had way lower expectations of it.  Somehow Hal Hartley and Pavement seem like the same thing.  

I've never seen Chariots of Fire, but thanks all the same for getting that song stuck in my head.

I watched Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol recently, too.  Liked that one better.  It was an exemplary action movie save for its one hideous flaw--the presence of Tom Cruise.  I don't buy him in anything.  I just don't get it.  Although I guess he was good in those photos you linked to today on FB.

Boston Terriers are so cute it's ridiculous.  Julie and Hunter have had them for 15 years or more.  I think maybe you met their dogs once? They vary a lot in temperament.  Is the neighbor's dog tightly wound?  Relaxed?  I always think of them as small, but now that I have Fuzzy I use a different measuring stick.  They look like labs next to him.

It really is cool how Fuzzy loves training.  Not sure what it says about dogs except that they're generally very eager to please their person.  According to the trainer (and not just my considerable bias) Fuzzy's a really smart dog.  The downside of that is higher anxiety and lower frustration tolerance.  The upsides are pretty obvious--quick learner, responsive, reads aloud sonorously.  He's a little like a herding dog in that he goes bonkers unless he has a job to do.  Also, training wears him out at least as much as physical exercise.  Probably more.</br></br>

What's new on your end? We had a little long weekend vacation last week. Went to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree. Palm Springs is odd -- like if the Rat Pack were gay they'd run the place. It's kind of upscale but weird. Tons of mid century modern furniture everywhere. 

We took a little side trip to the Salton Sea. Do you know what that is? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea. I'd never heard of it until I moved here. And we stopped at this insane Mad Max trailer town called Bombay Beach. I knew about it because my old roommate did the poster for a movie about it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Beach_%28film%29. It's this spooky half-burned out little town on a dying lake that's super depressing but also weirdly beautiful. 

And then Joshua Tree. The park is like The Flintstones meets Mars. The town is so quiet that it's disconcerting. You miss the background hum of traffic and helicopters and stuff.</br></br>

Barton Fink is a terrible movie.  So there.

I feel sort of sorry for Judd Apatow.  Everything he says about his wife makes her sound like a shrew.  But he's slavishly devoted.

<b> Jun 21, 2013, at 7:02 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Mostly waiting. Trying to learn what happened in the latest meeting on the Legion project. This one between Weed Road (Akiva Goldsman's production company, HQ'd at Warner Bros) and Gaumont (French financier and producer and theater chain owner with a TV division here in L.A.). They met yesterday, mostly to make sure they all liked each other and want to work together. Assuming they do, then the next step might be for me and my manager and Weed Road to meet with Gaumont's creative team, hash out creative stuff. I'm not sure how many more steps have to occur before I might get paid. Also, there are any number of ways the pooch could be screwed. But for now I'm hopeful, if anxious.

In the meantime I'm reading shitty scripts for Amazon and working on other pitches. And sometimes working on this horror movie thing with Scott Teems.

I don't really listen to podcasts much but today I listened to Marc Maron interview Judd Apatow. Really great stuff about how he became a comedy writer, mostly rooted in the fear arising from his parents' divorce. He was working in comedy as a teenager because he was scared he otherwise wouldn't be able to feed himself. He also used the ruse of a radio show to interview all his favorite comics back in the early 80s. Seinfeld, Shandling, Leno, et al. Like 16 of them. He aired four on his high school radio station but it was all an excuse to interrogate them about how to write jokes, how to get shows, how to achieve stability, etc.

We're maybe midway through the new AD. We both weren't really sure about it until Ep. 4. Then we laffed our asses off. 

Also I made Alison watch BARTON FINK the other night. I think she liked it but the ending is so surreal that it kinda threw her. 

Pizza is my achilles heel, man. Long story, but I've been actively trying to lose weight because (long story…) we booked these mule rides to the bottom of the Grand Canyon over Christmas, but you have to be no more than 200lbs with pack or they won't let you go. Right now I'm about 205. So anyway, the current diet is part of the ongoing maintenance to get the weight down and keep it down. Doing mostly soup / juice and some tuna. Ridiculous but effective. Anyway, that shit gets soooooooooo old. And on Wednesday Alison just mentioned pizza in passing and then I couldn't get it out of my mind. Could. Not. Shake it. I just had to order a pizza. Soup for dinner every single night is just such a fucking bummer, man. Also, it was kind of a depressing day, which didn't help. Pizza is just love and comfort and rightness in the world. That's what it is. So I had to have some. I'M NOT SORRY.

But I may have to walk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Still not sorry.

I found this entertainment jobs website that allows me to apply for lots of jobs I won't get in order to fulfill my requirements for unemployment. It's an age of miracles and wonders.</br></br>

Even though he has no sense of humor or self-awareness.

It played in Atlanta when we were there and the filmmaker / star dude came to introduce it. It used to play every Saturday night here at the arthouse theater near the Sunset Strip, kinda like Rocky Horror.

Fuzzy.  Well, yesterday he came to a dead stop on a walk.  I looked at him, and he had two tiny bird feet hanging out of his mouth.  Not exactly funny, but kind of scary and endearing somehow.  Then I smashed it with a stone.  That part was sad and very gross.

Oh yeah, and on our morning walk today he jumped up into someone's yard and claimed one of their plants with his special "That's mine, bitch" juice.  The homeowners were sitting on their front porch.  They didn't look very amused.  10 minutes later on the way back he took a completely unnecessary shit ON THE SIDEWALK right in front of these people.  He doesn't shit on the sidewalk.  He's not a savage (mostly).

<b> Jul 26, 2013, at 6:59 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Crazy thing is that the sequel to The Sparrow is even better. Which never happens.

Did you see the movie of Cloud Atlas? I actually really enjoyed it. I guess that puts me in the minority. I read the book too and they're sorta different but I didn't get the derision about the movie.

How the hell did your dog catch a bird?

In general I evaluate small dogs on a case-by-case basis. Like cats. I mean, one wants to generalize but then you come across a really cool one. I think it's hilarious that he just gave the ol' fuck you to those people -- like somehow he knew something you didn't and was like, "Let me handle this."

I about murdered a dog two days ago. I was running and I generally go the same way every day and know all the dogs along the way. But there was some new dog in a yard and he got out and came after me. Some small-mid brown dog. I tried to ward him off with a foot but he wouldn't stop so I took a couple kicks at him. That made him turn around finally and I was so pissed I chased him up the block. Then these two women came out looking concerned and I yelled at them to keep their fucking dog away from me. You know me: I am a lover of dogs. But a dog bites me and I will kill that dog and have the owner arrested, no question. 

Today I ran by there and no dog. I hope they realized they need to train him and leash him and keep their gate closed.</br></br>

<b> Jul 26, 2013, at 7:15 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Also, some other genre-ish books I've read, none as great as The Sparrow but some are good:

Alif the Unseen, by G. Willow Wilson. Kind of Young Adult fiction really but cool. 

The Half-Made World / The Rise of Ransom City, by Felix Gilman. These odd alternative westerns set in a world kind of like ours but weirder. 

The City and The City, by China Mieville. This noir murder mystery set in a city that exists in two planes of reality that overlap in some Eastern European country. 

None of them are as deep or direct as The Sparrow but they're good diverting reads.</br></br>

<b> Jul 29, 2013, at 3:48 PM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> That's good news about the sequel.  Is anyone going to make a movie from The Sparrow?  

I didn't see that movie.  I was reluctant to.  I'll watch it if you liked it.  I loved that book.  Kind of blew my hair bak.

It was a baby bird that Fuzz "caught."  Must have fallen from the nest and broken a wing.  Fuzz saw a motherfucking opportunity, and he motherfucking took that shit.  Bit the shit outta that bitch-ass tiny baby bird.  I was on the verge of shedding a tear, and he was all like, "Shut the fuck up, pussy."

Fuzz is a naughty little scamp.  A scoundrel.  He's not really a thug like I've just made him out to be.

Dude.  Dogs off leash.  Don't get me started.  Some fucking idiot lady said to me (after her off leash dog knocked Fuzz through the air and onto his back), "I think dogs were made to be freeeeee."  I said, "You may think that, but it's how most of them die in traffic."  I hate that woman.  Not just because of this incident but also because she seems a lot like my repulsive mother.</br></br>

<b> Jul 30, 2013, at 12:16 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> People have been trying to figure out how to film The Sparrow ever since it came out. For a long while Brad Pitt's company had the rights and they were working on a feature. But it just doesn't fit into two hours. Now I think AMC maybe has the rights and they're figuring out how to make it a series. But I don't know. Honestly it might just be best as a book. 

Your mileage may vary on the Cloud Atlas movie. It had been a while since I read the book and I went with low-ish expectations. But there was an unexpected sweetness or optimism to the movie. Basically, I'm the world's worst movie critic and if I feel something in a movie then I"m on board. So.

Don't lie to me. Your dog is a THUG. I can tell. Lives to fuck shit up. Birds better watch the fuck out.

I think I shocked Alison by declaring that a dog that tries to bite me is a dead dog. She knows that I am Bob, Lover of Dogs. But I'm serious. There are lines. I didn't claw my way to the top of the food chain by letting things bite me. I will fucking kick the shit out of any biting dog and have its owner arrested. I'm serious. You don't do your dog any favors by letting it run wild. Train it, leash it, be responsible. 

Today is one of those days that's scarily wide open. I hate those days. Perverse, right? I should just go to the park or something but then I feel irresponsible.

I finished The Sparrow last night.

Started a part-time job at Pleasant's today.

A few days ago I sent my friend Jamie a text that said, "I'm about to fart."  I was proud of that one which I guess is why I'm reporting it to you now.

I've been teaching myself how to program and use Arduino.  Working on a robotic treat-delivery device to help Fuzzy get comfortable being alone.

Did I tell you I got a roommate?  Mary.  She's in Alaska now.

Leaving the hospital, I had agreed to 3 goals.  Get a roommate, work with a trainer on Fuzzy's separation anxiety, and get a part-time job.  To the extent that making life possible is a good endeavor, it is good that I've now accomplished these 3 things.

How's Cate Haight?

Saw my current landlord, my landlord from the early 90s, and Courtney Bowles, with whom I am idiotically still a bit in love 20 years after we broke up.  Do you know her?  She and Rick Alverson were together for a long time, blah blah blah.  She is a truly fine person.

It was 59 degrees fahrenheit when I woke up the other day.  In August.  In Virginia.  I looked up what the record low for that day was (57 degrees), but I forgot which year.  If you're super interested, I'm sure you could look that up.  I should have typed, "If you're very interested."

The upstairs neighbors are fighting again.  Mother and teenage son.  Both redheads.  I don't have to tell you what that means, though, do I, hah aha hahahaha.

Speaking of which:  What's the difference between redheads and cats?

I have forgotten the punchline.  Do you know it?

That is all.</br></br>

We're flying in on Saturday, Sept. 14. We'll hang around Sunday. That's my birthday so we'll probably go find a nice restaurant or something that night (got suggestions?) then we'll drive to NC on Monday morning.

We come back on Friday Sept. 20 to catch an evening flight home. I'll forward flight details and all that once Mo sends them to me.

Can't go wrong with Acacia. That's where I'd go if I could afford it. Mostly very fresh seafood. Same deal with reservations. 

Many people like Heritage. I went once and thought meh. I'm willing to be wrong. I went during the first week. 

Many people love Rappahannock (the restaurant, not the river). I've not been. Food and cocktails sound great. Atmosphere maybe a tad faux-glitzy. 

Check out Pasture. No idea if its good, but it sounds interesting.

Lemaire at the Jefferson. That'd be both very good and kinda funny. Funny to show Alison that place, I mean. 

I'll keep thinking.</br></br>

Mama Zu is as good as ever. Not really oppressively expensive. No reservations and hard to get a table. But for 2 it should be okay.  I didn't put it in my list because it's not quite as much a special occasion place, but I do think you'd both like it.

We don't have firm plans for Sunday but I'll probably drive her around to some old haunts and whatever. We can meet up with you whenever you're free. And then dinner that night, for sure.

I'm debating whether to try to catch up with Scott Lewis and/or Eric Axelson for coffee. I know Scott sort of chaps you, and I'm mostly considering it simply because he'd be hurt if he found out I was around and didn't ping him. Dunno, might plead "too busy." But Eric is someone I genuinely enjoy. However, I hate hate hate overscheduling trips. And I'll see Eric in December when he's out in L.A. So…

I could conceivably suggest Monday a.m. coffee to Scott, before we drive to NC, which would limit exposure all around. I dunno.</br></br>

The Lincoln memorial coming to life really mystifies me. Did you build DC on rock n roll? I do not think you did. Also, less of your face please, singer guy.

I love right at the very beginning where the guitarist waits for it, waits for it, then yanks his guitar around and hits the "rock" lick. Ugh.

It's odd how it's such a similar aesthetic to that Yes video.

The beach was good. --Which was not a given. I felt we engineered things just right: four days with family, then out. I couldn't do five. There are certain givens of dissatisfaction. Like spending four days in the same room as my mom without any transfer of realness. That bums me out. But at this point maybe it's just the symbolism of going through it that counts. On the other hand, I did get to hang out with my two weirdo younger nieces and listen to them spin yarns of just utter lies. That was hilarious. My sister even said: Lizzie just lies about everything. But they aren't malicious lies. They're just fantastical. My youngest niece, Ruthie, is this little nutjob. Our thing is to tell absurdist knock-knock jokes. She SO doesn't get the concept, but it slays me. I just die. Meanwhile, my nephew is a 12 year-old boy. Nothing to report there. And the two older nieces are somewhat bookish and it will be interesting to see how things go with them. I have some hopes. In all, my sister and her husband are really good parents. An easy rapport with the kids. It's encouraging.

Also I did not get a sunburn, so that is a triumph.

FWIW, I read some dog books.  One was called "The Well Behaved Dog."  Every paragraph was like, well, duh.  I'm sure everyone is giving you advice, so here's mine: If you can, hire a "Certified Animal Behaviorist" for a few sessions.  Mine knows her shit, and she's never wrong.  Haven't seen her in a while…maybe a testament to her effectiveness.  Better than a book.

As if Das Füz is proof of that route's success.  He's behaving right now, in any case.

Now, on to your queries:

A) IT WORKS!  I mean, the machine itself works.  Whether or not it's going to lead to long stretches of peaceful alone time remains to be seen, but early indications are that it might.

B) Morrissey up and wrote an autobiography? That's really weird.

I've been "cold-cocked" by Lime-A-Rita.</br></br>

That is unassailable logic right there.

We have found a dog. Still deciding on names but he's a cattle dog. He got turned into the pound (in rural AZ, then rescued and brought to L.A.) because he was running loose, herding actual cattle.  Which is funny because he's super chill, for the most part. But it's the breed. We're stoked. We're bringing him home on Saturday. The land lady even met him and approved.

We're DEFINITELY hiring a dog trainer. Alison's dog fanatic friend, Bootsy (maybe you met her at the wedding? Seth's wife…), has a good one who's also cheap.

Dude, I can't believe you just decided to build a robot and then you did. That is some ninja shit.

What food are you going with?  I switched from total garbage to Orijen but did not go the distance to a raw diet, which I guess is what the rich dog nuts do.  I probably shouldn’t be splurging on the Orijen, but once I learned the truth about most dog food, I couldn’t see why I’d have a pet if I was just going to make him sick by feeding him stuff he was incapable of digesting.

And I guess that mini-screed illustrates your “I guess we’re grownups” point.  So many dog care decisions to make.

I think maybe Fuzzy is still getting comfortable at home after 11 months.  He’s not been a huge puker, but he sure did have the runs as soon as he got scared there for a while.  It (his bowels, that is) would flip like a switch.  

That’s really sweet about how petting lulls him to sleep.  Very, very sweet.  Thanks again for the pics and the sign.

<b> Nov 5, 2013, at 4:48 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> He’s a good boy. Very sweet and affectionate. Maybe borderline needy, but hopefully he’ll chill out when he starts to feel at home. He only seems to bark at cats and aggressive dogs. Likes kids and cool dogs. We’ve been gradually switching him over to new food so the week had some rough spots. We took him across town to dinner at some friends’ (it was Mo’s birthday on Halloween) and he puked in the back of the car. Probably a rookie move to feed him right before we went. Poor guy likes the car okay but it’s easy to get seasick in L.A. stop-and-go traffic. But he was good once we got him there. But then the next day we were taking him to the dog park and he had diarrhea in the car. Thank GOD we had just put a seat liner back there for him. Poor guy. So he was sick for a couple days. But he’s better now. It’s funny how getting a dog makes us ask each other things like, “How was his poop?” I guess we’re grownups now. (A flock of like thirty squawking parrots just flew over — one of the local oddities. The mouthy little bastards.) We think he’s starting to loosen up and feel at home a bit. He’s started to spazz out when playing with other dogs and Mo took him to run on the high school field nearby and he just went apeshit. He was pretty reserved all week. He’s so funny because when you pet him he will gradually just collapse. He does these hilarious flops. We love him.</br></br>

You can really go down a dog food rabbit hole.  The main thing seems to be no grain (or not much) and lots and lots of meat.  

The trainer I’ve worked with told me to use Gwaltney chicken hot dogs as treats.  I mean like little, tiny pieces.  Fuzzy loves those so, so much, and they’re way cheaper than other treats.  I swear I could train him to fly a plane with those things.</br></br>

We use Wellness food. I don’t know the whole rationale but Mo had a long talk with some lady at the Petco. Seems fine. It’s not, like, vegan or any of that shit, but I think it may be organic.

</b> <br><br> The haps. 

I'm on the train from DC to Richmond. I'm in the Quiet Car. Are you familiar with the Quiet Car? It's just what it sounds like--no phones, no conversations above a whisper. They do not address clapping, farting, etc.  Quiet Car devotees (myself included) are kind of a peevish lot. Some of us seem to sit here just to shush people. I have witnessed gob-smacking acts of sonic hypocrisy on the Quiet Car. 

Sometimes I think Louie CK should be the first guy to win a Nobel Prize for Literature because of a TV show. I'm guessing you've seen it?  I thought the last 4 episodes of season 3 were so beautiful, so moving. 

Life is so dull. No, Tim, it's you who are dull. Life is beautiful and full of vivid colors and dogs and shit. I know, I know. You're right. I'm so dull. Why am I so fucking dull?

It's been really rainy all day, but now the motherfuckin' sun is out, beeyotch. 

I continue to like my job selling nuts and bolts and screws. I never should have tried to be a therapist because I find satisfaction in helping people out. All I had to do was get a job in a hardware store.  Sometimes people are so touched when I help them that they shake my hand and are profuse with their gratitude. That is rewarding. Then I make them suck my dick. 

No, not really. I don't make them do that. But when they offer, I don't say no. 

I love my boss, Linda. I knew her for years as a customer. She's a great boss. Fair. Decisive. When we fuck up she says, "Boi, I'ma bust yo head down to the white meat."  Once this conversation happened between Lunda and me:

Linda (speaking to a customer who then left the area): blah blah blah get it up blah blah blah

Me: Ha. You said get it up. 

Linda: Don't think I won't come over there and get yours up. 

Me: There's no way anyone is going to get this abandoned little noodle up, Linda. 

Linda (miming removing dentures): Don't be so sure, sweetie..THESE come out. 

Her ribaldry knows no limits. She and I are spiritual siblings in that.  But she has many facets, and god knows she knows her fasteners. 

When I walk onto a train car or something, I like to try to spot the most attractive woman in the car. Do you do that?  Assuming Alison isn't present?  Alison would win every time, no question, if she were present. 

Note: Business class on Amtrak is for douches who think they should be on the good car. It's barely different. Da fuck?  And it costs a whole lot more. Dum-Dums. 

You should see the sunlight on those smokestacks. Beautiful. 

I watched Galaxy Quest for the fourth time last night. 

My roommate has started dating. I heard her having sex. That was weird. Made me feel twenty-something.  Also, the dude was unbelievably vigorous. My vagina was so sore just by proxy. 

Fuzzy remains a scallywag. I cannot afford to keep taking him to doggy daycare.  Soon he will have to spend the four hours of my shift alone at home. 

Am refinishing the doors in my apartment. Seems like certain small changes have a disproportionate effect. 

Big Ryan McGinness exhibit at the VMFA soon. They're recreating his studio. The art handlers keep buying screws and shit for it. 

Passing Quantico. FBI training ground in addition to a marine base, right?

Man, I didn't like American Hustle as much as everyone else. I liked Amy Adam's wardrobe. I wonder how much she would like to make sexy time with me. Probably a whole lot, right?  Well get in line, Amy Adams, because Cate Blanchett and any number of short-haired androgynous models of the last twenty years are in front of you. 

Sorry for the thumb diarrhea. Stuck on this boring-ass train. I've totally got my weenis sticking out of my zipper, though. Still, that's kind of boring, too. 

And you? Was ist das happs mit du?</br></br>

But yes, I heard Sarah Silverman has a tattoo that says "insert dirty joke here" with a downward arrow on the small of her back. 

I love the Quiet Car.  But I spend almost 5 hours a week on it, and I've seen some crazy things.  One anecdote that perfectly embodies the human downside of the quiet car. Too long to type with my thumbs. 

Dog anxiety. Benzodiazepines. Any vet should be able to help with that, I think. At least that was the case here. Ativan, Xanax, etc. I was giving Fuzz Ativan when I first got him, but weaned him off as he adjusted. 

Good to know about Amy Adams. I guess I'd have to go to LA. Or I could wait for her to come to Richmond. I think that's what I'll do.</br></br>

I think he used to be more straightforward songwritery guy who filled in space with little improv bits, but then the improv just took over. Which is no doubt for the best. First time I saw his shtick I almost wet myself. There’s soooo much good stuff of his out there on the shminternet…</br></br>

Ryan got in touch as if out of the blue.  He’s giving a lecture at VMFA on Thursday, wanted to see if we could catch up.  I am astounded and glad.

I’ve been working on getting Fuzz to be able to hang out happily for the 4 hours that I work most days.  It’s not going all that well, but maybe there’s progress.

</b> <br><br> It was good to hang out with him.  And weird.  If it’s possible to be off-the-charts narcissistic in a non-awful way, he’s doing it.  So there’s no real depth in the conversation unless it’s about his work.  Which is fine.  His wife, Trish, is like a translator for him.  They’ve been together since we were in 11th grade.

The one awkward—but also illuminating—topic was the disposition of all the early stuff I have.  His view is that it possesses "a high level of cultural value" and near-zero market value.  His preference would be that I give it to VMFA or MOMA more or less now.  Apparently every artist at his career stage would prefer all of their work to end up in museums as soon as possible because they’re the only entities with the resources to make it last “forever.”  Collectors are a necessary evil, I think.  I told him that this trove of stuff is my single asset and that I wasn’t in a position to hand it over to anybody.  So he said, short of my doing that, he had no interest in how I handled it.  This wasn’t harsh.  Just incredibly direct.  Then he was bored with the topic.

I need to get that shit in acid-free containers and a fire-proof safe.  And get it insured, which I’m positive I can’t afford.

Here’s a nice thing about all of this: He really gave me my due during the lecture while discussing early interests and influences.  It is nice to be not-forgotten.

Marrow bone.  Yes.  I get them at the Kroger meat counter.  He loves those.  I like the peanut butter idea. One problem is that he’ll knock any damn thing out of his crate and then become obsessively focused on it, sometimes making the pads of his feet raw by trying to claw out of the crate.

Today the little bastard was in the truck while Julie and I were having lunch.  In his panic to get to me, he unlatched the back windows (I mean, WTF?), jumped into the bed of the truck and then onto and across the parking lot.  Another customer saw him standing on his back legs with his front paws against the door’s glass.  Across a parking lot.  I am so tempted to sell him on Craigslist, and sadly, I’m not joking.  I’m ANGRY with him, which just makes zero sense.

Did you know that I used to have a real-deal pedal steel?  The difficulty of that instrument is probably on-par with a pipe organ.  It’s like if you combined a pipe organ and six or seven separate theremins.  That’s neat that that dude makes a living like that. Very surprising. It would’ve been funny if he had been pretentious. The pretentious pedal-steel guy.</br></br>

<b> Mar 1, 2014, at 5:22 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I like the idea that he’s a savant because it kinda takes the pressure off the rest of us. 

Was it good to hang out with him?

Our neighbors just left for the hospital to have a baby so we’re looking after their little dog, Papi. (Pictured below.) I’m not really into chihuahuas or dachshunds, and he’s both, but he’s actually a pretty good dog. Not my speed but perfect for them. Not a lot of fuss.

We’re trying to sort out what to do with Angus — and now also Papi — during the Oscars party tomorrow. Angus kinda maxes out at around 3 hours in the cage before he shows signs of anxiety. Not even counting Papi running around loose. Sometimes we’ll take him and leave him in the back seat while we do whatever we’re doing. He seems fine with that, actually. Way better than being alone at home in the cage. No idea why.

I dunno if you’ve tried this but we also give him a fresh bone when we leave him. The pet store sells marrow bones for a couple bucks a pop. But when he’s done with those we put peanut butter in them and freeze them. Seems to occupy him for a while.

We just went to brunch with some new friendos we met at a party. Dude’s a lawyer / writer and his wife’s a songwriter. And they invited another couple along who happen to live in our neighborhood. And that guy plays pedal steel for a living. Played with Son Volt, Alejandro Escovedo, Ray Lamontagne, Over the Rhine, etc. Nice guy, totally unpretentious. It still kind of blows my mind that there are working sidemen who have a whole long professional career. Hard to imagine that life.</br></br>

Not sure you know this, but I lost the ability to appreciate music about a year and a half ago. Did you know that? It's the weirdest thing. Also my sense of taste comes and goes. When it goes, I wouldn't know the difference between dog poo and smooth peanut butter. Anyway, today I made a Pandora station based on Badfinger (no idea why), and "popular song" is sounding Tolerable Plus™. Good news. From Tim. 

I shared that thing about Clancy's 1/2" reel-to-reel on FB because of what you'd posted about those old tapes. Any news there?  Sounded potentially explosive. 

Pandora just tried to play "Layla" for me.

Now I am, though.  Sugar mama.  Also, here’s the thing: If she doesn’t answer my email (which I suspect will be the case), I won’t be terribly saddened by that.  But if she does, I’ll be stoked, as she was a pleasure to chat with.

That is awfully funny about Ryan Gosling.  I sure hope you had sex with him after that.</br></br>

<b> Jun 10, 2014, at 8:25 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Yes, it’s very common to give out a fake gmail address. I do it every time I’m approached by some slavering fanboy, for instance. In fact, I’m doing it with you right now. You think you’ve been talking to Bob Massey these last 20 years but in fact you’re talking to “Bob Massey,” portrayed by my assistant. (Who has been instructed not to break character.)

Does she live in RVA? Because she’s an awfully attractive woman. Also it must be really weird to be an actor in Richmond. Does one reach a level that allows one to live outside of NYC/LA? I guess it must happen but I always thought that would be super famous people.

Can’t remember if I told you this but I once gave the “what’s up” to Ryan Goslling totally by accident. It was before he was an internet meme. He looked familiar and I thought he was just some guy I’d met at a party. NOPE.

But yeah, it’s weird here. You see people you vaguely recognize and you never know if you actually know them or you saw them on TV.</br></br>

<b> Jun 10, 2014, at 9:14 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Oh I eyeball-fucked him. SO HARD.

I do not personally know anyone who gives out fake email addresses. But then, I’m not a girl and so this concept may not have actually crossed my radar in real life. I’ve seen it on sitcoms, I think. Though once upon a time I was at a German beergarden here and I was joking with my buddy about doing him some favor if he got the waitresses number. So he did. And she wrote 867-5309. Which we all laughed about uproariously. I liked her even more then.

We just bought Angus a bath at the groomer’s today and holy shit is he clean and fuzzy. He’s like a fucking cotton ball. I can’t stop petting him because he’s so soft and clean. But now he’s also bedecked with a truly flaming bandana (courtesy of groomers). And he smells like someone’s grandma.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yeah, totally.  I very hazily remember watching the Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978.  Have you seen that?  It’s basically unwatchable.  But what I remembered was this extremely-low production value Star Wars TV show that was somehow conflated in my mind with the Fisher Price Treehouse play set.  Whatever memories I had were fragmentary and weird.  Anyway, I googled it in like 2007 and there it was.  Watching it was like watching a dream.  And the wookies lived in trees.

I met a guy whose friend grew up in the Soviet Union and had a similar experience with an insane propaganda stop-motion film made for kids.

The Star Wars thing was obscure, but I guess nowhere near as obscure as a shitty Soviet animated short from the same period.

But before Youtube, finding something like that really could have taken years and been the job of pro researches, right?  Like you’d go to the Museum of Television and Radio or whatever.  I don’t know, it’s almost like a collective unconscious of the past 100 years, and that’s super weird.

The other thing that’s weird is that Donnie Iris has a fan.  And that he (had to have been a dude) wrote that comment.

Although I really do like something about that song.</br></br>

I think the legacy of SWINGERS + the $$$ from his big studio movies + a general lack of deep awareness on the part of the moviegoing public = the illusion of coolness and hilarity. Or something like that. I mean, why do people think Garfield is funny? Same reason.

My self-summary

Message me if you are 1) intelligent 2) attractive 3) classy 4) well traveled 5) well read 6) artistic 7) funny/witty/goofy 8) independent 9) stylish 10) into music 11) honest 12) kind 13) loyal (***lucky 13 right?)

Someone once told me that in order for a relationship to be successful, that each person should feel like they're getting the better end of the deal. This theory makes sense to me and it's what I base my dating life on, which might be why I'm still single. I'm a pretty good end of the deal, but haven't yet given up hope that I will find a better end of the deal for myself. I wish I could remember who told me that, because I would surely give them credit.

"Remember, it's never too late to fall in love. It's just too late to fall in the kind of love that isn't a complete compromise based on a fear of dying alone." --The Onion

No cats, no smokers, no alcoholics, no druggies, no gym rats, no slobs, no gluttons, no racists, no sexists, no homophobes, no atheists, no gamers, no military, no sadists, no dentures, no jobless, no non-readers, no offense.

Please make sure your photos are current. Mine are EXTREMELY current. Be honest. Be upfront. It's the decent thing to do.

Don't waste your time sending me hate mail either. I will neither care nor respond.

I am looking for a relationship, so don't waste my time if you know that you are not. I'm raising a child by myself and that's serious business. If that's too much for you to handle, then I am sure there are plenty of 20 somethings on this site for whom you might be better suited. I am a grown up and am looking for the same. I have a nice house and a nice car. I do not need your money and you should not need mine. If you have money, then good for you, but don't use it as a power play. That is so not hot. I won't fall in love with your money, that's a guarantee. If you're broke, I'm likely to be turned off by that as well, because you probably made some bad choices in life that contributed to your lack of funds. I want someone who can hold his own and I don't think that's too much to ask. Yes, you should have your own health and dental insurance.

If you send me a message containing the word "penis," you abso-phucking-lutely are guaranteed to not get a response. Just a heads up boys. I prefer tall guys, even if you're jacked.

I enjoy planes, trains, and automobiles, exploring, concerts, camping, adventure, shenanigans & such.

You can find me on Facebook under the name Crystal Blue Persuasion. If you send me a friend request, I might add you if you don't appear to be a weirdo stalker. On Twitter, I'm @CrystalVision29, although I rarely tweet. Crycrycrystal is my Instagram name if you care to see what I'm up to on the regular.

What I’m doing with my life
I'm a National Board Certified Counselor, currently employed at an elementary school, and former English teacher. I'm doing the best I can at being a mother--my daughter means everything to me--and trying to work as a photographer and painter on the side.

I encourage you to check out my site: www.crystalvisionphotography.com
If you don't like what you see, hear, or read there then guess what--you're not my kind.

I spend as much time as possible near the ocean or doing something outdoors. I am also a certified group exercise and pilates instructor. I am working on my doctorate degree in K-12 Education, so I spend a lot of time reading scholarly books and doing research.

I was married for 10 years, divorced after a 4 year split. I'm hoping to meet that special someone though, preferably someone artistic but stable, without any serious vices or addictions. I do believe in love & happiness, as well as Al Green. Love takes work though. It has to be fed.

I also hope to meet someone who is honest, not just honest with me, but also with himself. There is a distinct difference. I know myself well. I want my partner to be on the same level of self-awareness. I am not looking for someone to compete with. Anything I do in life, I do it for my own self betterment, not because I'm trying to beat someone else. I don't like to feel like my partner is trying to one-up me.

Negativity is a huge turn off for me as well. If you are a glass half empty kinda guy, suffer from depression or any type of mental disorder, please do not write me. Yes, it's true--I am a counselor; however, I am looking for dates, not clients. Angry, bitter, cruel, mean--any of the aforementioned are not attractive qualities and will send me a runnin'.

Lastly, if we go out and you want to have an exclusive relationship, you need to express that. Assume nothing with me. If you don't tell me you want to see me and me only and want reciprocity, then I will continue dating other people. If you are clear and straightforward about what you're looking for and what you're after, you will have a much better chance of earning my respect. I am not a fan of mind games or manipulation. I'm not looking to hook up or for a booty call or whatever.

I'm seeking something that will ultimately last and someone with whom to go the distance. This takes time. I am not in a rush, although if you do not make time in your life for me, expect the same in return. I like and need attention from my partner. Affection, lots of sweet kisses, and genuine compliments will get you really far. I can be easily distracted, but if you catch me, I am loyal and committed. However, if you do not rank me high enough on your list of priorities, I will float away like a butterfly, and rest assured, it will sting like a bee.
I’m really good at
photography & painting, decorating, styling & makeup, although most of the time I don't wear any makeup. but if feel like gettin' all gussied up and feelin' fancy, I can do some fierce freaking makeup.

Staring into space without blinking and mannequin modeling for money. No shit. A teenage girl recognized me at the ice skating rink the other night. That was cool.

I'm also pretty good at writing, singing, cooking, & chess.
The first things people usually notice about me
My smile, my eyes, my height... I've also been told that I have nice hands.
Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food

The good stuff--you know. Why waste time on anything else?

I like all kinds of food, except meatloaf.

I don't watch much television. Yep. It's true.
The six things I could never do without
1. God
2. my daughter
3. music
4. something to read
5. family
6. friends
I spend a lot of time thinking about
--how to be the best mom ever.

--bikinis, bubble baths & toenail polish.

--why some guys think it's cool to wear visors and pleated pants.

--why a dude would ever wax his eyebrows or go to the tanning bed. that's just weird.

--why bald guys on this site think they can trick you into thinking they're not bald by wearing ballcaps in every photo. dude, if you're bald--embrace it. my dad does.

--when I'm gonna poop next.

--how I'm probably gonna deactivate this account soon. this site kinda gets on my nerves.

I have a slight fascination with astrology and according to the books, I am more compatible with the following signs:
Taurus
Capricorn
Cancer
Scorpio
Virgo
Leo
On a typical Friday night I am
throwin' down at the local Honky Tonk.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit
I'm black from the waist down & on the dance floor.

I have 5 tats & 2 piercings.

I like white boys that look like monkeys. Seriously, the less evolved you appear, the more likely I am to be attracted to you.

I probably didn't read your profile. I might have just looked-ed at your pictures to see if you're hot.

I've blocked 6 or 7 dudes from messaging me on this site. One messaged me 6 times requesting photos of my feet from various angles. Another dude asked if he could masturbate while making out with me. I couldn't make up this crap if I tried. I might write a book about my experiences thus far. Don't be that guy.

I'm creeped out by fake teeth and weird moles, especially on the
face.

I always look at a guy's hands and feet. You figure it out.
I’m looking for
Straight guys only
Ages 32–42
Near me
Who are single
For new friends, long-term dating, short-term dating
You should message me if
You read this entire profile & it wasn't the most you've read all year.
You are more of a chimp than a gibbon.
You have a full set of good teeth, and by good I mean real, not artificial.
You have several photos posted & you don't look like an ex-convict in any of them.
You are not married.
You are not a swinger.
You are not shorter than 6 ft.
You are not a sports fanatic.
You are not old enough to be my dad.
You are not a sexist, or any kind of, pig.
You are not lying about your age, job, income, height, or gender.
You don't have a beer gut or a food baby.
Your nipples are not exposed on your OKC profile.
You are not completely full of crap.
{I prefer people who poop on the regular.}
You are not an addict of any variety.
As a male, you answered the question, "Would you ever like someone to strap on a dildo and put it inside me?" with an emphatic ---------------------------------->"NO!"
Your IQ is above average.
You don't have to be an academic, per se, but I do have a thing for smart guys.
You've travelled outside of the U.S. to at least 3 countries.
You look and/or think like Anderson Cooper, but are still straight.
You have added me to your favorites.

If you don't meet this criteria, I don't think any less of you--not that you should care either way. I'm just looking for someone compatible with me. Also, if you write me and I do not return the message please do not think ill of me. I prefer not to waste anyone's time. It is of the essence, you know. I could very well be madly attracted to you, but you might live in another country or state, thereby making it virtually impossible for us to shag. And in the end, it's all about the shagging, now isn't it?

Half of this crap is just made up for kicks & giggles. Obviously in the end, it is about MORE than just a shag.
Interested? Go ahead…Send her a message</br></br>

I won't fall in love with your money, that's a guarantee. If you're broke, I'm likely to be turned off by that as well, because you probably made some bad choices in life that contributed to your lack of funds. I want someone who can hold his own and I don't think that's too much to ask. Yes, you should have your own health and dental insurance.

If you send me a message containing the word "penis," you abso-phucking-lutely are guaranteed to not get a response. Just a heads up boys. I prefer tall guys, even if you're jacked.

I enjoy planes, trains, and automobiles, exploring, concerts, camping, adventure, shenanigans & such.

You can find me on Facebook under the name Crystal Blue Persuasion. If you send me a friend request, I might add you if you don't appear to be a weirdo stalker. On Twitter, I'm @CrystalVision29, although I rarely tweet. Crycrycrystal is my Instagram name if you care to see what I'm up to on the regular.

What I’m doing with my life
I'm a National Board Certified Counselor, currently employed at an elementary school, and former English teacher. I'm doing the best I can at being a mother--my daughter means everything to me--and trying to work as a photographer and painter on the side.

I encourage you to check out my site: www.crystalvisionphotography.com
If you don't like what you see, hear, or read there then guess what--you're not my kind.

I spend as much time as possible near the ocean or doing something outdoors. I am also a certified group exercise and pilates instructor. I am working on my doctorate degree in K-12 Education, so I spend a lot of time reading scholarly books and doing research.

I was married for 10 years, divorced after a 4 year split. I'm hoping to meet that special someone though, preferably someone artistic but stable, without any serious vices or addictions. I do believe in love & happiness, as well as Al Green. Love takes work though. It has to be fed.

I also hope to meet someone who is honest, not just honest with me, but also with himself. There is a distinct difference. I know myself well. I want my partner to be on the same level of self-awareness. I am not looking for someone to compete with. Anything I do in life, I do it for my own self betterment, not because I'm trying to beat someone else. I don't like to feel like my partner is trying to one-up me.

Negativity is a huge turn off for me as well. If you are a glass half empty kinda guy, suffer from depression or any type of mental disorder, please do not write me. Yes, it's true--I am a counselor; however, I am looking for dates, not clients. Angry, bitter, cruel, mean--any of the aforementioned are not attractive qualities and will send me a runnin'.

Lastly, if we go out and you want to have an exclusive relationship, you need to express that. Assume nothing with me. If you don't tell me you want to see me and me only and want reciprocity, then I will continue dating other people. If you are clear and straightforward about what you're looking for and what you're after, you will have a much better chance of earning my respect. I am not a fan of mind games or manipulation. I'm not looking to hook up or for a booty call or whatever.

I'm seeking something that will ultimately last and someone with whom to go the distance. This takes time. I am not in a rush, although if you do not make time in your life for me, expect the same in return. I like and need attention from my partner. Affection, lots of sweet kisses, and genuine compliments will get you really far. I can be easily distracted, but if you catch me, I am loyal and committed. However, if you do not rank me high enough on your list of priorities, I will float away like a butterfly, and rest assured, it will sting like a bee.
I’m really good at
photography & painting, decorating, styling & makeup, although most of the time I don't wear any makeup. but if feel like gettin' all gussied up and feelin' fancy, I can do some fierce freaking makeup.

Staring into space without blinking and mannequin modeling for money. No shit. A teenage girl recognized me at the ice skating rink the other night. That was cool.

I'm also pretty good at writing, singing, cooking, & chess.
The first things people usually notice about me
My smile, my eyes, my height... I've also been told that I have nice hands.

The good stuff--you know. Why waste time on anything else?

I like all kinds of food, except meatloaf.

I don't watch much television. Yep. It's true.
The six things I could never do without
1. God
2. my daughter
3. music
4. something to read
5. family
6. friends
I spend a lot of time thinking about
--how to be the best mom ever.

--bikinis, bubble baths & toenail polish.

--why some guys think it's cool to wear visors and pleated pants.

--why a dude would ever wax his eyebrows or go to the tanning bed. that's just weird.

--why bald guys on this site think they can trick you into thinking they're not bald by wearing ballcaps in every photo. dude, if you're bald--embrace it. my dad does.

--when I'm gonna poop next.

--how I'm probably gonna deactivate this account soon. this site kinda gets on my nerves.

I have a slight fascination with astrology and according to the books, I am more compatible with the following signs:
Taurus
Capricorn
Cancer
Scorpio
Virgo
Leo
On a typical Friday night I am
throwin' down at the local Honky Tonk.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit
I'm black from the waist down & on the dance floor.

I have 5 tats & 2 piercings.

I like white boys that look like monkeys. Seriously, the less evolved you appear, the more likely I am to be attracted to you.

I probably didn't read your profile. I might have just looked-ed at your pictures to see if you're hot.

I've blocked 6 or 7 dudes from messaging me on this site. One messaged me 6 times requesting photos of my feet from various angles. Another dude asked if he could masturbate while making out with me. I couldn't make up this crap if I tried. I might write a book about my experiences thus far. Don't be that guy.

I'm creeped out by fake teeth and weird moles, especially on the
face.

I always look at a guy's hands and feet. You figure it out.
I’m looking for
Straight guys only
Ages 32–42
Near me
Who are single
For new friends, long-term dating, short-term dating
You should message me if
You read this entire profile & it wasn't the most you've read all year.
You are more of a chimp than a gibbon.
You have a full set of good teeth, and by good I mean real, not artificial.
You have several photos posted & you don't look like an ex-convict in any of them.
You are not married.
You are not a swinger.
You are not shorter than 6 ft.
You are not a sports fanatic.
You are not old enough to be my dad.
You are not a sexist, or any kind of, pig.
You are not lying about your age, job, income, height, or gender.
You don't have a beer gut or a food baby.
Your nipples are not exposed on your OKC profile.
You are not completely full of crap.
{I prefer people who poop on the regular.}
You are not an addict of any variety.
As a male, you answered the question, "Would you ever like someone to strap on a dildo and put it inside me?" with an emphatic ---------------------------------->"NO!"
Your IQ is above average.
You don't have to be an academic, per se, but I do have a thing for smart guys.
You've travelled outside of the U.S. to at least 3 countries.
You look and/or think like Anderson Cooper, but are still straight.
You have added me to your favorites.

If you don't meet this criteria, I don't think any less of you--not that you should care either way. I'm just looking for someone compatible with me. Also, if you write me and I do not return the message please do not think ill of me. I prefer not to waste anyone's time. It is of the essence, you know. I could very well be madly attracted to you, but you might live in another country or state, thereby making it virtually impossible for us to shag. And in the end, it's all about the shagging, now isn't it?

Half of this crap is just made up for kicks & giggles. Obviously in the end, it is about MORE than just a shag.
Interested? Go ahead…Send her a message</br></br>

He feels like he’s asserting his will more, but almost in the way a teenager might. Only comes when he wants to, won’t go in the back yard when we tell him, doesn’t eat all his food, etc. And he completely rebelled against sleeping in his cage — which he loves. One night at bedtime he went and climbed under my desk and wouldn’t come out, so I was like: Fine, fucker, do what you want, we’ll see. Now he just starts the night loose in the house and then later goes into his cage by himself. Weirdo. Probably part of finally settling in.

Well, it’s due to Mr. S. King on Jan. 15. So I’ve got til then to make it awesome. However, in a couple weeks I may be starting work as a story editor on a TV show. Which is great news because we’re super broke. It’s a thing Seth helped sell to Netflix. Called “True Horror.” Basically it’s a doc series in which they recreate horror scenarios that happened to real people. I’m gonna pitch them me dating Mary MacInnis. No, actually, my job is to take these people’s probably inarticulate stories, do more interviews, and shape them into a narrative. Could be cool, actually.



What does it mean that the diocese is going to pay me a few tens of thousands of dollars when I have no legal leverage?  I think it means they know how fucked up shit was in their diocese back then.  So much sex and drugs.  

Oh it means they are very happy to pay you money rather than have that stuff come out in the papers. They totally know that would open the floodgates. And then someone who does have legal leverage would show up.</br></br>

The Robin Williams thing was incredibly sad. So sad. It didn’t t-bone me like DFW did but it was just horrible. I avoided the shit out of all writing on the subject. Just too real.

I am still working on the King script. It’s just now coming into clear focus, I think. My method is to write and rewrite treatments or outlines until I have a firm handle on where I’m going and how to get there. It’s interesting what stuff sloughs off with each draft. And what new stuff crops up. My trick with this one is distilling it to the essence. I started out with something way more complicated and overbaked but now it’s getting streamlined.

Alison is mostly shepherding Seth’s TV projects and helping give notes on the big upcoming movie. Plus reading the usual onslaught of crap that people send Seth. Right now they’re shooting this new TV show called “Marry Me” that I’m pretty certain is gonna suck out loud. And the pre-production for UNCHARTED (the big actiony movie) is ramping up. 

BTW, I didn’t ask about the Thundershirt for Angus. He’s fine. I just thought you might try it for Fuzzy, but you were way ahead of me. 

Yesterday we went on this epic walk / hike up Mt. Washington (a nearby neighborhood up on a steep hill) to check out this joint called the Self-Realization Center — some yoga / Hindu / white rich people in saris  joint that is said to have amazing gardens where you can just hang out. Kinda like Maymont. In fact, the gardens were quite lovely and we laid on the grass for a long time. But so we took Angus, as you do. But we’ve been super paranoid about over-working him on these hikes because recently our friends Mary and Clay went on vacation and left their dog Kima with their best friends, and those people took Kima and their own dog on a hike in Malibu, and Kima overheated and died. It was HORRIBLE. Just beyond fucked up. So whenever Angus kinda lingers in the shade, we take a break. 

Dude, I love The Wire so much. Man, you have no idea how great it gets in seasons 2 and 3. Really 3 is the motherfucker. I’m reading this book called “Difficult Men” about the third golden age of TV, which includes David Simon who created The Wire, David Chase / Sopranos, Alan Ball / Six Feet Under, David Milch / Deadwood, Matthew Weiner / Mad Men, plus some others. The stuff about The Wire is super fascinating. Also, I would fucking murder David Chase if I had to work for him. 

Did I tell you that Andre Royo, who plays Bubbles, lives around the corner from me? His wife’s a restauranteur. They have a super modest little joint. I see him around all the time and he is a sharp dresser. 

I had no idea that you’d found a way to go forward with the legal stuff. That is great news! Do you know how to sail already? I love that idea. Right now there’s a giant rubber ducky in Port of Los Angeles. Maybe you could team up somehow.</br></br>

I like the Mary MacInnis story.  I wouldn’t mind throwing in my small coda to that story.  That job does sound pretty great, though.  What a way to meet a person—by interviewing them about some tender moment.

Your assessment may be correct re. the Episcopal Church.  On the other hand, it doesn’t seem like this settlement is enough to constitute hush money.  Although I may be very cheap.  I don’t know.</br></br>

<b> Oct 1, 2014, at 1:33 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Also, a warning about boats:

When my dad died, I inherited a couple of boats from him. Mostly not in great shape. But there was one, a mahogany Chris Craft speedboat, that should have been worth a lot of money. But what I learned the hard way from a buyer is that rot is not always easy to detect but if it’s there, you’re in trouble. 

So.

I’m assuming you haven’t yet bought a boat. But when/if you do, MAKE CERTAIN you find someone who is a motherfucking EXPERT and take them with you. Someone who knows how to detect rot and other structural / mechanical problems. Boats are a fucking pain in the ass. They’ve been the bane of two generations of men in my family. Boats are basically a perpetual battle against entropy. Don’t get rooked.

Okay.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> Believe me, I hear your warning.  It’s all true.  I frequently say similar things to myself.

Some people say owning a boat is like standing in a cold shower with your clothes on while throwing money down the drain.

People who buy wooden boats are either dumb, rich, or both.  I wouldn’t dream of that.  

The other main source of sorrow besides rotting wood is motors / engines.  I’m looking at small sailboats.  I may or may not need a tiny outboard.

I’ve been taking along my sailing mentor (not sure what else to call her) when I look at boats.  That’s been helpful.  I’m looking for something really small that I can learn on. Some day I hope to get the smallest boat I could live on if necessary.  If that day comes, I’ll hire a marine surveyor.

Still, thanks for the warning.  Repeat at will.</br></br>

<b> Nov 15, 2014, at 11:25 AM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I do have a boat now.  Its name is Red.  Photos below.  

Getting Red is the best thing that’s happened in my life in the past few years.  Massive despair reduction.

I hadn’t planned on getting a boat this size, but I met a very experience sailor who pushed me in this direction.  The previous plan was to buy a much bigger boat when the settlement money arrived.  I’m glad she steered me this way—there’s so much to learn just to become non-dangerous on a sailboat, let alone proficient.

I can only sail when the wind is under 10 mph and only in a protected harbor for now.  But just that is ridiculously glorious.  I’ll dick around out there for a while then drop anchor and take a nap in the cabin.  Nice water lapping against the hull sounds.

This boat can be dragged around on a trailer and stored on one, but Doreen (the sailing mentor) found me a short-term marina spot for $50/mo, which is practically free.  So I can drive to Urbanna (an exactly 1:10 ride), rig stuff up and be on the water in 15 minutes.  It’s getting cold enough now that I don’t expect to be getting out a whole lot until spring.  Many, many improvement projects planned over the winter.

An electric trolling motor gets me in and out of the marina.  It’s silent.  No fuel cost.

There’s an immense amount to learn.  So far, I’ve encountered only intelligent, skilled, and generous sailors.  Kind people who offer lots and lots of help.  I’m sure there are entitled rich snob sailors around, but I’ve yet to meet any.

Sailing is fun.

How did you meet Doreen?

Man this is so cool. I love these photos. Conspicuous absence of Fuzzy in a sailor’s cap, though. Does he go on the boat?

I kinda love this training regimen idea. Really get comfortable, learn what’s what, prepare. Eliminate dumb mistakes. Man, I gotta say I’m also relieved you got a fiberglass boat (or whatever it is). Not wood. Wood looks so beautiful but what a disaster to maintain.

Do you listen to a lot of Christopher Cross?

Do you know all the words to that Looking Glass song, “Brandy?”

Do you meet willing women but part regretfully by saying, “What a good wife you would be — but my life, my love and my lady is the sea” — ?

I do. And I’m married. And I don’t have a boat.

Actually, usually it goes: “Angus, you’re a fine dog. What a good wife you would be. But my life…” etc.

</b> <br><br> I met Doreen at the dog park.  Man, she’s been helpful.  When she was a teenager she sailed from Newfoundland to Ireland with her family.  Nobody does that.  Everyone sails towards warmth, not the North Atlantic.  Her dad, who is a psychiatrist, must’ve been nuts.  She’s back in Florida now.  Is rarely in Richmond, but had to be in town to take care of some business.  So I’m lucky our paths crossed.

Whether or not Fuzzy will participate in sailing is an open question.  He’s such a dick on the drive down there.  I shouldn’t say that.  But it’s true.  Well, what’s true is that Fuzzy isn’t comfortable in new situations, and he quickly spirals upwards from nervous to panicked.  Still, I’ve taken him down there a couple of times and put treats all over the boat, and he’s liked that, so who knows.

I hate that Christopher Cross song a lot a lot, and most people reflexively ask about it upon hearing the word “sailing.”  Yes, I just said that you are like most people.  Still, sailing has so many tacit associations like that.  With that song, with class issues, and so on.  The reality is surprisingly different.  Doreen says that she’s been in anchorages in the islands where other sailors were plumbers and neurosurgeons, and somehow the sailing thing and its associated comraderie trumps everything else.  To whit, one of the old salts I’ve been spending a lot of time with seems to have been the dean of UVA’s law school (according to a third person) but refuses to talk about any of that.  My point is that Christopher Cross is seldom, if ever, discussed.

These people are a friendly lot.

When I start sailing on the big water, I’ll blast Sliang Laos.  Fuck you Christopher Cross and Jimmy Buffet.

I remember hearing that Christopher Cross song at K&K Toys in Virginia Beach while choosing a Star Wars action figure.  I’m nearly certain that was the day I got a Jawa.

I’m glad Miriam got in touch.  She’s been everywhere recently.  Scotland, Paris, Berlin, Sedona, Denmark, Montreal, and so on.  She’s been living in Berlin.  Her book is just coming out, and she’s on sabbatical.  I don’t know why she and Lance are going to L.A.

Oh, have you watched Transparent?  Miriam just finished that yesterday.  I found it almost overwhelming, but deeply enriching.  I rank it amongst the best art I’ve ever encountered.

I have just imbibed an entire bottle of wine.

How’s your King script going?

What else is news?

What’s with Angus?

How’s Alison?

Oh, Doreen was briefly in a band with Perry (from Plan 9) and some of the Schicks.  Weird.

This most certainly doesn’t need ten hours and my prediction is that we will never find a definitive answer for who did it but our intrepid reporter will turn that into a reflection on the nature of storytelling, expectations, news in the social media age, etc etc barf. That is, she will make the show about herself — which it already is, basically. And I will puke. And she will be a star.

So that’s why I think they don’t edit out her doubts. Because that’s what the show’s about. 

I’ve told a number of people I’m expecting it to go full Twin Peaks Season 2 and wander in circles until it ends. All that said, I’ll probably listen to the whole thing if I have time. Which thus far I haven’t. I’m several episodes behind and if I’m honest with myself I don’t really care.</br></br>

<b> Nov 24, 2014, at 7:51 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Alison’s mom and step-dad are visiting. They’re nice people and I like them. But, man, they can talk. Especially her mom. They go on these hour-long screeds about politics — and even though I mostly agree with their politics, it’s all this vehement preaching to the choir. I hit my introvert wall really quickly with them. I have to leave the room. Alison’s mom talks and talks but never says anything. At least, nothing real. Just blah blah the state of the world blah blah. If I ever felt it wasn’t all just this weird facade then I wouldn’t feel so taxed. But even Alison is at her limit now. 

She took them to the Paramount lot for the studio tour today, though, which sounds like it was really cool. They came back with some funny stories. 1. There’s a full replica of Lucille Ball / Desi Arnaz’s house on the lot, including their back yard. They owned a bunch of Paramount at one time, and because Lucy got so much heat about being a workaholic rather than a mom (1950s ahoy), she used to take photos with her kids in her “back yard” and release them to show what a great mom she was. 2. She also had the door to Desi’s dressing room cemented shut after she learned it was where he took starlets for trysts. 3. I’ve been there a bunch and there’s this one huge wall of a sound stage that’s painted like the sky. It’s right next to a parking lot. But what I didn’t realize is that they call it “The Tank” because the parking lot is sunken four feet and sometimes they fill it with water to shoot ocean scenes against the fake sky. They did some WATERWORLD there and some other stuff. The tour guide takes you around, shows you a spot, then on his iPad shows movie clilps that were shot on that spot. I love shit like that. Pretty cool.</br></br>

Red (my boat) is sitting in my sister’s backyard during the off-season.  I’m going there most days to do various little improvements and fixes.  One nice thing about that is I get to spend lots of very casual time with my niece and nephew.  Like just-hanging-out-doing-shit time.  It’s good.

I have a funny dating story, but it’s too long to write about.  At least it’s too long to write about now.  But I have met a nice person named Lauren with whom I suspect friendship is likely.  Whether or not I will place my genitals into her genitals is unclear.  If that were to be the case, it’d be a long way off.  I’d make her work for it, that is.

I watched the first half of Nymphomaniac. It was much better than I anticipated. 

Tomorrow the winds might be 40mph. 

That's all I got.</br></br>

<b> Feb 15, 2015, at 5:28 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> That’s a bold move. I would have to rehearse kind of a shit ton. But it’s nice to have people you can call on for that kind of thing. I recently started a sticky listing all my half-finished songs that I’d like to shape into something. There’s a shit ton but they all require a good bit of work. And I’m not all that motivated, beyond just pure enjoyment. I realize that should be enough, theoretically, but it’s kind of not.

I’m curious about Nymphomaniac but haven’t yet gotten around to it. I hope it’s at least sort of funny. All I saw in previews was brutality mixed with sexy sexiness. Also, isn’t Shia Leboeuf in it? Kinda can’t stand that guy. Charlotte Gainsbourg, on the other hand...

Last night we watched The Disappearance of Elanor Rigby, which was kind of slowish and emotionally taxing but pretty good. It was a little like Blue Valentine, if you saw that.

Now I will watch the second Hobbit movie because I’m in the mood for escapist stuff and I haven’t seen it.

No huge news here. I’m getting paid finally to work on that Netflix gig, True Horror, which is what it sounds like. I’m not a horror guy but it’s fucking nice to get paid more than chump change for a little bit. Next week we’ll meet with Scott Teems to concoct a battle plan for my Stephen King project, which is potentially exciting. 

The dog just licked a dollop of peanut butter off the porch tiles. Super gross.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Chesley has colon cancer.  It has spread to her liver and lung.  She has limited time, I expect.  She came to tell me at Pleasants', and I guess, to say goodbye.  It’s the second time I’ve seen her in 5 years.  So it’s a strange experience emotionally.  I don’t think about her much, and when I do, it’s increasingly positive with the passage of time.  This raised a lot of other feelings, less positive ones.  Anger, for instance.  Regret.  Sorrow.

Perhaps the saddest / weirdest part was that she did not seem in the least bit sad.  It was almost like she was glad to have come across a shame-less exit.</br></br>

<b> Mar 19, 2015, at 12:06 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Good. Making coffee. Sweeping up dog hair. Not sure why it isn’t Friday yet.

I have an unusual amount of screenwriting activity occurring (none of which pays me, at the moment, though it could), which is somewhat stressful. After like 2.5 years of working on it with three different producing teams, my “Legion” script just went out to the first round of production companies. Then one told John, my producer, that he read an identical script recently to which Guy Ritchie is attached. So that gives me hives. But there’s often competing projects on the same subject, so I’m hopeful that we can beat them to a network sale. We’ll see. I don’t even bother to hope for best case scenarios at this point — for better or worse. I hope for a few positive steps.

Man, it sure was dumb to grow up as an arty kid. I should have grown up as a ruthless capitalist.

Our dog is stinky. But he is sweet. I think we’re gonna take him in for a bath today. He hasn’t had a bath in this calendar year. I did, however, discover that Trader Joe’s sells minty breath bones. So his dog breath is becoming less “dog breath” and more “old lady sucking on a complementary candy after dinner at the steak house.”

Dude, do you have access to HBO at all? Holy shit, we just watched that doc series “The Jinx” that’s in the news. Stunning.</br></br>

We’re trying a new groomer today and I’m hoping he doesn’t come back smelling like grandma. But it’s unlikely, I think. I don’t know what they use to wash him but it might be Aquanet.

I think you’re onto something with the oceanfront home, though. That would address a number of life issues for all involved.

I’ve been reading a FB thread about worst gigs ever played. There are some doozies. I think I blocked most of mine out, though. Which is a shame because that was most of them.</br></br>

How did you know about that??

I know I’ve seen that video in my youth but I never would have put it together.

Man, they are a shitty, shitty band. So shitty. Like, there’s a kind of purity to their shittiness.

Also, you are correct about Amy Mann. So much craft. Too much. Trapped in craft like bug in amber. Nothing you can really point and say, like you would of Rush, “Man is that shitty.” No. It’s worse than that.</br></br>

<b> Apr 12, 2015, at 6:05 AM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So it looks like they remove all hooks on the first edit and then on the second they replace each word with three words.

This is hilarious to me. It’s so dead-on.

Peart totally writes middle school poetry, which is probably not unrelated to why middle-schoolers fall so hard for the band.

I didn’t know any of their story. The car accident thing is horrifying. Their response makes me like those guys — those guys who are in a bad band.

No one ever really mentions how alike Rush is with RVA math rock. But it’s so glaring.

BTW, “one of those nordic death bands you like” should have quotes around “like.”</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> I guess I’ve kind of become fascinated with them since I watched the Rush documentary on Netflix.  They have these beautiful relationships between each other that I found moving.  Peart is on the outside of the Lifeson-Lee dyad because he’s a mega-introvert, but the other two have worked—and I mean really tried—to learn how to be there for him and to give him what he needs.  This seemed to be especially the case when his wife and child were killed in an car accident.

But their sensibility is just so utterly and totally and completely and absurdly foreign to me.  I can’t help but be entertained by it.  It’s as though they write a song and then on the first edit they scrupulously remove all hooks. It’s more antithetical to good pop music than, like, one of those nordic death bands you like.  “That two second passage could easily be hummed by a 12 year old: CUT IT!”

But it’s the lyrics that push everything over the edge.  Google translate should offer an English —> Peart option.  And vice versa.

Here’s the first sentence of the above paragraph in Peart:

However, one may find the words that crest the notes of pitch and time 
are those that preciptously breach the hardened precipice”

Or, “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” 

One’s preference would be to clasp the other’s metacarpus.

So it looks like they remove all hooks on the first edit and then on the second they replace each word with three words.</br></br>

Like, I've been enjoying revisiting Joy Division recently--especially the few TV appearances, and I kind of want to watch "Control," but I dunno...something feels false or macabre or [something else I can't articulate] when actors play people who were very much alive during my lifetime.

I’m going to start pitching bio pics about people who are still alive. And working. See where that gets me. Like maybe a bio pic on Paris Hilton. Maybe she’ll finance it.</br></br>

<b> Jun 1, 2015, at 7:42 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I’m pasting in an actual idea I wrote down after reading a book written by a former paparazzi I knew named Jennifer Buhl. In her book she made a suggestion in passing that certain celebs know exactly what they’re doing and manipulate the media just as much as the media manipulates them. I loved the idea of Paris Hilton as this natural media genius because of her upbringing (and lack of any particular native talent). I’ll probably never write this but I’m kind of into the idea.

MEDIA GENIUS / THE HEIRESS / NEW BREED / 
(not being flip)

Girl who’s heiress of hotel dynasty but essentially without skills or talents and unknown. But what she does know, at bone-deep level, is how to manipulate media. She’s seen it from the cradle.
(i.e. Paris Hilton)

Point here: To show her actual genius, in which she gets what she wants—fame—but not what she needs—love. She mistakes the one for the other. But this isn’t an expose or hit piece, it’s about empathy for a lovely sweet girl who wants what we all want but is utterly lost as a soul because she’s never struggled for anything. But she will struggle for this, and we’ll love her for it, but if we’re paying attention we’ll also feel deep melancholy that no one has ever said to her: you are worthy for you—not your name, money, body, media prowess, etc.

World: extreme privilege, no need to work or struggle for anything, and this is crippling.

Want: fame / to be seen.
Need: love / to be known (so different from being seen).

Begins fully alive: has everything the world can offer plus genes, no idea it could be otherwise, life is cake. 
But indifferent father, doesn’t really know her? Then she overhears someone not knowing who she is—maybe next to some famous celeb, who the someone “loves so much”—and that sets her off.

(How is this about the American Dream, a la THE GODFATHER?)

Her hubris: to think achieving fame will bring fulfilment / love.
Or: to think you can earn (your dad’s) love (by forging your own achievements).
M. Corleone’s: to think you can be part of, yet not part of, the Family.

She seduces (metaphorically) a rookie pap (a la Jennifer Buhl), offering deal: access for control. (This pap will see her / his big break, jump on it, but pap will eventually be the only voice of reason, maybe the moral guiding voice, who in the end tells her she is losing her soul. Maybe make the pap the protagonist? She’s like M. Corleone’s wife, maybe.)
And like M. Corleone with wife, the deal is: You never get inside my media creation. I’ll give you good shots, and you’ll make money, and I’ll get fame, but you never get the real me. –But then, in the end, just once she does. And she says what’s on her mind: You will lose your soul. –And there’s a beat of silent or subtextual or veiled acknowledgement… but then she’s expelled from Paradise forever. Broke the deal. 

(And the pap maybe nurses crush on semi-celeb, Adrien Grenier like, and is tempted by the glamour but in the end does not succumb—and so keeps her soul—unlike the heiress.)

Also fold in the father. Just like Don Corleone. Look up those beats.

First act break: makes and leaks a sex tape. (Or is this midpoint?)
Then photographed with Bible.
Then goes to jail.
Then exclusive interview with most famous legit journo, Larry King or better.

Midpoint: 

End: We make it look like she succeeded, but for those paying attention she disappears in the spotlight and there’s nothing left there.


KEY: Take her 100% seriously. No irony. No snark.</br></br>

I tried so hard to like Trainwreck. Couple of laughs. Not my bag.

Six dates sounds like “dating.” What’s her story?

I frequently find quotes from that Tom Waits bit floating around my brain. “Real meat snack.” “There’s no dignity in that.” I laugh aloud, apparently for no reason, which scares people.

I have never watched Curb.

“More than anything / I want to be / well-dressed in a coma.” — Morrissey


Angus is great. The best dog. So happy. However, he HATED HATED HATED the weeks around July 4th. Fireworks = no bueno. He just curls up. We actually got him sedatives and a Thundershirt. Poor guy. He doesn’t understand what’s happening. I have a theory that he was shot at as a young pup. It would fit with what we know of him before he came to us.

Me and Alison are good. Working our asses off. Mostly counting down to our September trip to France. Her best French friend is getting married and it’s one of those weeklong events in the basque countryside, etc etc. I expect to run into Julie Delpy and Marion Cotillard, at minimum. If God is good, Gerard Depardieu will crash the party and do a belly flop in the pool. 

Lately it’s been a lot of meetings / pitches for me with big executive people. There is nothing more draining than pitching five seasons of TV. It’s like compressing an entire hourlong set of music into 20 minutes. It wipes me out. I don’t know why they make writers fucking dance like monkeys. Just read my shit.</br></br>

I want to put that on an endless loop.

I need new boots, Tim. My Redwings are on their second set of soles. I’ve been eyeing some Blundstones but I can’t decide if those really work for me. I like an ankle-height, masculine, but stylish boot. My Clarks were comfy but are worn out. I dunno, Tim. I dunno. I just had an intuition that somehow you would have the answer I need. HELP ME TIM.

It’s funny, the game of medical expectations. And by funny, I mean not funny. We humans who have survived some affliction are like: Hey man, take some lung, it’s cool, as long as it’s not cancer. Totally 100% okay with that.

Rebecca is not entirely wrong about White People Music. I guess that’s a pretty broad brushstroke. And, in the wrong light, could come off like Mary MacInnis saying “I hate white people.” But she’s not entirely wrong, as I am reminded every goddamn day when I read the music blogs. But let’s not overgeneralize: Brown People Music has some clunkers too. I mean, I can’t think of any offhand, but I’m certain there is a brown Death Cab For Cutie out there. Somewhere.

My most frequent quote is, “She was used piece of spent jet trash…” Actually, I don’t quote it much but I play it a lot because it makes me laugh every time. His delivery is so perfect.

I think “coffee shops” had a different connotation back in the 70s and 80s. Back when coffee was dirtier and illegal. I stand by TW on this one.

It takes a big man to confess to being so lowbrow. I mean, you talk a good game. But let’s face it, Tim: you’re poor white trash like the rest of us. You grew up on Skynrd and creamed corn and your roots are showing. Except for Charade, which is aspirational in much the same way throwing your birthday at Applebee’s is. Hey, they throw in a little one-candle chocolate cake for free! 

The important thing is that Lebowski is at the top. I think as long as that’s true, you don’t need to apologize for anything else.

I’ll spare you the details of how I arrived at my recommendation.  I trust that resoling the Redwings again is not an option because the uppers are somehow damaged?  Because if you could resole them again, I’d say do that.  Are they the nice "Redwing Heritage" kind?  

Barring a second resoling of the Redwings, I think you should you should stick with Clarks desert boots.  I bought my second pair this afternoon.  My first pair I bought to wear to your wedding.  I’ve worn those boots nearly every day since then.  One resole.  I’d resole them again but Fuzzy did a number on them.  Odd because he’s not generally a chewer.  Anyway, my view of those boots is this: They’re the rare “classic” that is not also very boring. They work in every casual situation and many formal situations too, though I don’t generally find myself in a lot of those.  They can be worn with everything.  Even shorts if you’re adventurous.  They last forever.  You can have rubber soles put on by the factory.  I have the beeswax brown ones.  It’d be nice to have a black pair and one of the lighter suede ones.  And because they’re typically just under $80 at DSW, owning more than one pair isn’t completely out of reach.

That said, if I could get a pair of Aldens, I would. My expectation in that case would be a lifetime boot apart from soles.  I don’t know about Blundstones but that sounds like something from The Flinstones.

Rebecca/White People Music. Not like Mary.  Not a self-serving political statement.  She pretty much just likes music to dance to and broadly equates that with people of color in a faintly tongue in cheek way.  I think.  She asked if she was going to hate my music and I said oh, yes.  Yes, definitely.

I wonder what the porn parody of The Mission is called.</br></br>

Yes, the Mission is tough. And definitely for that reason you named. Maybe longer titles lend themselves to that a little better. 

Aldens are the perfect exemplar of that thing where people with means win in the long term (even cost-wise) because they have access to capital up front.  I don't give a shit about that when it comes to luxury brand mania, but it really bothers me when it means that you can't enjoy the proud handiwork of good craftsman unless you're rich.</br></br>

<b> Aug 2, 2015, at 9:37 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> No, I’ll get the Redwings resoled at some point. But I just did it a few months ago and they’re already wearing out again. The issue is that I wear them every day. And my feet pronate so they wear out fast. So I’m strongly considering getting a second pair (different color maybe) in hopes that alternating makes them last longer. They’re just so fucking expensive.

I should probably get my Clarks resoled too. Didn’t know that was an option.

Also: oh sure, Aldens, if you have $500.

Perhaps you should introduce Rebecca to this: http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/reich-remixed. Make that Venn diagram overlap a hair.

It’s weird how hard it is to make a porn parody title out of The Mission. You’d think that “mission” would lend itself to one but it’s not as easy as that. 

Today in the NYT I read about this comedian who has a funk band called The Nasty Delicious. Which is perfect.</br></br>

Two weeks ago Julie had lung surgery to remove a mass. They determined it was cancer, and found a second, smaller mass nearby. They then removed 50% of Julie's left lung as well as some nearby lymph nodes. 

The mass was an atypical carcinoid. It had entered the lymph system. All extremely bad news. 

She's still recovering from the surgery and is having trouble dealing with her reduced lung capacity. She'll meet with her oncologist to discuss treatment options, though to be frank, one possibility is no treatment at all. 

Atypical lung carcinoids are associated with 50 - 70% survival at 5 years. 

As for me, I'm alternately enraged and bone-deep exhausted.

I am once again at The Bamboo. 

I've been having like hot flashes.  My temperature is normal, but other people are astounded by how hot my palms are. I'm astounded by how warm I am when it's 40°. 

Julie and I went to an evening with Jeffrey Tambor or some such last night. Man was it weird. I'm not sure he'd ever done it before. It was like a very pat motivational speaker. Genuinely awful. And surprising in that way. But there was this:



Obviously I'll cherish that image forever. 

Julie is in a holding pattern. Had her second of four shots to shut down her ovaries today. Like the opposite of IVF.  They need to do this before the real treatment begins. She's doing pretty well day-to-day.

I personally am good. So’s Alison and Angus. I’m glad to hear Julie’s been doing well at least day-to-day. Do you know my friend Ann Jaeger? She was one of my housemates at the Kansas House in Arlington. Also worked at the Black Cat for a long time. She was living out here after years of disappearing off the map. She just appeared one day. Had been living in New Mexico. But she’s a gruff sweetheart with a heart of gold. Anyway, she found out she has colon cancer. She was in UCLA hospital for a while. Now back in DC with her sister while she tries to get insurance, an oncologist, and treatment. Fucking nightmare that she’s handling like a goddamn champ. I guess what other sane response is there? Not that it’s rational at all. 

I’m slaving away on this Billie Holiday project. Totally slammed. Which is probably okay. Better than the re-/con-/ob-/in-verse. 

I would like to be at the Bamboo.

Legion… No real idea. Last I heard this financier was taking it to Netflix to pitch it to them. But the producers are off on a movie shoot and impossible to get on the phone. Kinda worries me. Feels a little like being dodged, especially since it’s my manager calling them.

Was planning on pitching this Billie Holiday project to Sony this week but it got pushed a couple weeks. No biggie in the scheme of things, but I’d like to get it done and move forward.

We hung out with a couple of French friends who were in town this weekend. We went to three bars and one taco truck. Shoulda ate more tacos because Alison couldn’t stand up to get back to the car and the next day, even though I wasn’t that hungover, I actually barfed in the bathroom of a diner where we went to recover. So that was kinda dumb. Fun to see the Frenchies though.

Going up to Seattle area around Christmas time. We have a no-family policy for holidays but she wanted to hang with her friends up there. So we’ll drop in on her folks at some point but we booked a room for Xmas Eve / Xmas at this hotel that’s a converted school. Kinda crazy. It has several bars and restaurants in the complex. Could be great or could suck, but it’ll be a story for sure. http://www.mcmenamins.com/AndersonSchool

I mean, for a critter who vaguely resembles a wolf, Angus is a total fucking pussy.

I’m pretty sure I read an article about that topic like a year ago. Somewhere like the Atlantic or New Yorker. The writer speculated on the same topic. I think his thesis was that dogs (/wolves) actually tamed us. Not vice versa. I could see that, honestly.</br></br>

Horrifying is just the flipside of funny. What do they teach you in the class? Probably shared this before, but I took every writing class my college offered. But I had no idea what to write about until my 30s. Time. So weird.

I’m not sure if I’ve ever been to Staunton. I mean, I must have, right? What took you out there?

Speaking of dystopian fiction, have you seen the show Black Mirror? Have we talked about this?

Me: grinding on two scripts, trying to finish this one so I can get paid. It’s one of those for-hire projects that aren’t great but you do the best you can with what you have to work with. I’m so sick of it. Next weekend I’m going to Columbia, MO, for the True/False film fest.

</b> <br><br> Hi.

Sorry for my long time out of touch.  There’s no reason for it, and there is no news to speak of.

Just walked to the grocery store for frozen pizza, coffee, and fake grape nuts.  I got to thinking what if some people had mourning dove-induced cardiac arrhythmia?  Like if they heard a mourning dove their hearts would vibrate sympathetically and they might die?

Finally watched The End of the Tour.  It was even eerier than I expected.  Pretty good, I thought.

Finally reading Crazy from the Heat.

Pretty much off Facebook, and for no particular reason.  It’s like I just forgot to keep checking it all the time.

Had a bunch of people over for Miriam’s annual goodbye before she goes to Montreal, and when things were winding up Fuzzy got an entire block of cheese and ran around with it covering his entire face before we could catch him.  Comedy!

What’s news witchoo?</br></br>

Nothing dramatic here. All my projects are sort of in limbo awaiting moves by other parties. Which drives me nuts. I have to invent things to keep myself busy. A little music, trawling for new script ideas, re-painting the interior of our place, etc. The useless production company on this Billie Holiday project is making a halfass attempt to get Viola Davis to hear our pitch. The Stephen King film project is out to Netflix. The Legion project is out to a new round of producers. I’m awaiting notes from my managers on this new thriller thing I wrote. We’re pretty broke so we don’t have any big fun plans beyond a weekend in the desert in September.

How about you?</br></br>

I forget: what’s the deal with the writing group?

I’m totally gonna check out that Ben Winters thing. I just read this book called “Area X” at the behest of my neighbor Erik. It’s sci-fi set in something like the present about this quarantined area that’s maybe infected by an alien presence that seems to transmute people into these other types of beings, almost like weird mutations, but the whole thing is super trippy because you never really get satisfactory answers about what’s actually happening. It was unsettling. And it turns out the guy who directed EX MACHINA is doing the first book as a movie. I’m curious about it because there’s basically no story. All mood.

Über seems like it could be pretty okay. I’ve thought about it in slow periods but both our cars suck.

Sorry to hear about the Issues. Grr.

Today I learned that Atom Egoyan, who directed THE SWEET HEREAFTER, later directed a film written by Rupert Holmes — the guy who wrote “The Pina Colada Song.” So I guess there really are second acts in American lives.

Angus is lying here next to me, sighing with ennui. This is the stretch of the afternoon between my habitual 4pm coffee run (he likes to ride in the car) and the 7pm walk. It’s hard out there for a dog. They don’t have jobs, you know. They can’t really shop — no shoes, no shirt, no service. 

Me and Alison just DIED watching Der Füz play Schöenberg. He seemed really into it. I’m tempted to post that for my composery friends except that composers have zero sense of humor about that kind of thing. Can’t remember if we’ve talked about this, but I’ve long been fascinated that Schoenberg and Stravinsky — who were kind of musical nemeses — both found themselves exiled to Los Angeles at the same time and so wound up being tennis partners. Because who the hell else are they gonna find to argue with? There’s a play in that, or something.</br></br>

So far I’ve just done 10-minute riffs on whatever pops in my head at the moment, but this session I’m trying to write about my own mental illness as well as mental illness more broadly.  It’s more of a healing pursuit, I think, than like a “learn about writing good” kind of thing.  I’ll attach one of my blurbs from Monday.

Costumes: I keep thinking about disguises.  About doing things in the world in disguise.  Or visiting out of town friends while in disguise so that everyone I met there would think that was the real me.  

Area X sounds good.  I’ll read that.  Just started East of Eden, though, so it’ll be a while.

What must he have seen as he was spirited down the Himalayan foothills on a stretcher made of repurposed canvas and sticks?

Did he watch the blurry jungle canopy rushing by green and lush, dotted with monkeys and strange birds?

Did he see the back of the man carrying the front of the stretcher down a much steeper cliff than he’d ever seen in more than a decade of living there?

Did he study the man’s neck and curly black hair and his powerful, dark back?

Did he look up and see the face of the man carrying the rear of the stretcher? Did he know that man well? Did he study the many tattoos on that face, one for each head he had hunted and brought home to shrink on a pike in front of his hut in the time before the missionaries arrived?

Did he see anything in his mind? Did he worry over failures or savor successes? Did he think he would die? Did he think it was malaria or bad water or a spider bite or poison or God’s wrath or cholera or any of the myriad deadly fates that had felled thousands of Anglos before him?

If he did think those things, he was wrong. He was not dying per se, but he was gravely ill. My great-grandfather, James Riley Bailey, was catatonically depressed.

He was mute and psychogenically paralyzed. His wife had figured it for a stroke or a tumor, but it wasn’t. It was an unholy and relentless tsunami of stress that had welled up and crashed against  the well-ordered beachhead of his mind.

Did he want anything? Did he pray? Was he scared?

It was a long, almost invisible path straight downhill all through jungle. He thought of nothing. His mind was absent.</br></br>

<b> Aug 19, 2016, at 2:48 PM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> There are also deathbed confessions, sworn promises to keep secrets, and a baby swap (my father was the baby) that didn’t come to light for 60 years.</br></br>

<b> Aug 19, 2016, at 4:39 PM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> There were 9 children, all but one born in India.  The two most involved in this story are Eleanor and Edith.

In 1944 Eleanor adopted my father in Detroit. They’d all settled there after India. It was a unilateral decision as her husband Harry McCready was in Scotland towards the end of the war.  Harry came back after the war.  They adopted another child, Joyce.  Harry beats Eleanor up all the time and one assumes the kids, too.  Finally when my father is 18 he’s had enough, beats the shit out of Harry after hearing him roughing up Eleanor.  Harry leaves the house.  Eleanor, Joyce, and my father go into hiding for fear of Harry returning to kill them.

Time passes.  Harry shoots himself.

My father becomes a sadist. But that’s neither here nor there.

In the early 70s Eleanor remarries.  Fred was my grandfather as far as I was concerned.  But to my father, it’s not like Fred was a stepfather.  I mean, my father was 40 or so.

Fred has this whole other gigantic catholic family in Rockville, MD and thereabouts.  The only one that matters is Cheryl.

As Eleanor and Fred become enfeebled, my father and Cheryl have a major disagreement about what to do with them.  Afterwards, they’re not on speaking terms.  They were never close to begin with.  I mean, they barely knew each other.

Eleanor dies in 1999.

Fred dies in 2002 or 2003.  I’m the only McCready who goes to the funeral.  That’s when I was living up there, as you know.

In 2006 Cheryl comes out of the woodwork and contacts my father.  She says there’s something she has to get off her chest.  When her father, Fred, was in his last hours, he told Cheryl that he had been keeping a secret that he just couldn’t stand taking to the grave.  Fred tells Cheryl that my father was never really adopted so much as taken from her sister Edith.

Edith was mentally ill.  But she’d met a man who loved her and wanted to get married.  My father was born.  The family, dour Baptists that they were, forbade Edith to keep her child.  So my father was his adoptive mother’s nephew, and his aunt, who he met once, was his mother.  Edith was so wayward as far as the family was concerned that they shunned her entirely.  She died alone and very likely in squalor in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1979.  Nobody knows how she got there.

Anyhow, Fred, who I think my father treated with scorn and condescension, just couldn’t bear dying without telling my father the truth.

The thing is, the reason it was so hard to tell my father was that Eleanor had gone around making everyone swear to never tell my father even after she was dead.  Apparently, she actually insisted that people look her in the eye and swear it.  Something was broken in her character, in her heart.

Anyway, once I heard about all of this I got more interested in my father’s family than I had been before.  I’m interested in the family history of serious mental illness.  But I’m also interested in the intergenerational transmission of trauma. 

My heart breaks over and over for Edith, my grandmother.</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Weird
</b> <br><br> The how of it is almost harder to explain than the thing itself. I mean, it’s improbable when you consider how fractured my family is.

But I’ve always known certain parts of it.  Like that my grandmother and her 8 siblings had grown up in the Naga hills in the far northeast of India.  I grew up going to her house, where there was all kinds of weird shit around.  A bearskin rug (with head) that was made from one of her pet bears.  A python skin.  An elephant’s foot. And non-animal stuff, too, like garb and gear.

My great-grandfather was a Baptist medical missionary between 1910 and 1928.  Most of what I know about it comes from a collection of letters and memories that my grandmother kept.  

About 10 years ago I got in touch with the Baptist Foreign Mission Board.  They sent me some records, mostly stuff I already had.  But maybe a week after I got that envelope, an Indian surgeon here in the US called me.  I guess she’d sought records for the same territory at about the same time. Anyway, she called to tell me that her great-grandfather was my great-grandfather’s assistant and that he was pretty much a fully competent doctor by the time my great-grandfather left.  She wanted me to know that there was big new medical center in Assam named after the two of them.

There are lots of interesting stories.  The hook that keeps bringing me back is the mental illness.  There are also deathbed confessions, sworn promises to keep secrets, and a baby swap (my father was the baby) that didn’t come to light for 60 years.</br></br>

<b> Aug 19, 2016, at 3:41 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Wow. That is an amazing story.

How do you know all this about your great-grandfather? I know almost nothing about my great-grandparents. What was he doing in the Himalayas?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Thanks for saying so. I guess I feel like my real feeling about it (renewed muted resentment) is an unacceptable thing to admit. But that is in fact my main feeling. 

She never acknowledged her behavior, that she was having an affair, that she told me she had never loved me in an airport food court after I surprised her with a pit stop to see Nick Cave, and so on. She never apologized. Consequently I was only able to forgive but so far. 

What is forgiveness in the absence of contrition but some form of enabling?  Fuck that. 

I ended up pitying her. She behaved badly because she was mentally ill and had no insight into that dynamic. In fact she leaned on it to prevent people from holding her accountable. I have also behaved badly because of mental illness, but for whatever reason--probably nurturing friendships and staying in therapy--I do have some insight and have been able (however spastically) to make amends where necessary. I have no idea what that difference might have been. Luck or grace?

It wasn't all bad, though. She was a funny person. She loved dogs. She had an interesting aesthetic sensibility. Still, those are no reason to get married.</br></br>

Once I saw an amazing quilt thing at the Corcoran. The quilts of Gee's Bend. These women in some remote deep south place were making quilts out of scraps from a Levis factory, and they looked like art being made at the same time in New York. 

My phone wanted to capitalize Deep South. Is that right? What about great white north?  No, I guess not.</br></br>

I was looking at that photo of Angus on the quilts again. Did you know that Cate’s twin sister Alissa lives next door and started a thing called the Modern Quilt Guild? It’s nationwide. They have conventions. They do stuff that could be in museums. Here’s Alissa’s: http://www.alissahaightcarlton.com/quilt-gallery/</br></br>

I'm glad that has passed so our time together is good without my having to fake it. People say anger is a part of grieving. I guess I worked through a lot of it ahead of time. 

I only connect with her actual mortality fleetingly. It's like a breeze or a ghost. And it's just hellish. It's unbearable. I'm grateful there isn't more of that right now. 

I'm worried about the oral chemo. I'm worried her doctor gently bullied her into it. I'm worried that it'll make her too sick to be able to rationally demand no more. I'm just generally worried. She and I both want her to die with as little hideous suffering as possible.</br></br>

I’m not proud of this, but I feel a mild sense of schadenfreude. That guy goes around writing uncalled for shitty reviews and happily pointing out everyone else’s hypocrisy.  Someone on the Reddit thread about this incident wrote something like, this guy’s been searching for the line forever, and now he has found it.

Mike McCready.  Weird.  He probably is some kind of relative.  Therefore I will soon be asking him for some of his money. I mean, you will ask on my behalf.  Thanks in advance.  Do you work with Scott very often?  Will you be spending more time in Seattle?

Happy birthday to Alison.  Which one is it?

News here.  Julie is doing so-so.  She’s not undergoing any kind of treatment which means that whatever care she gets is for symptoms.  Pain, mostly.  I’m driving for Uber. Fuzzy is making noises for dinner just soft enough to avoid my ire while making his purpose known. I’m still writing in that weekly group and some in-between, and that’s been good for me. For the most part I manage to remain ambition free about it.  I’m mostly writing about this mill I worked at for a couple of years, Ruffin & Payne, which was peopled with all kinds of desperate and interesting fuckups.</br></br>

Dumbass.

In other weird news, I went up to Seattle with Scott Teems this week to pitch this a TV show idea to this guy from Pearl Jam. He has your last name, Mike McCready, so he’s probably your brother. He was nice. I think you’re a better songwriter though.

It’s a murder mystery / coming-of-age story set in the Seattle music scene before the explosion of grunge. Scott was more affected by all that than I was but it’s a cool story and I’m glad to be involved with something that might actually get me paid for once.

Also today is Alison’s birthday. 

What’s up?</br></br>

Apparently being in Pearl Jam is a lucrative undertaking. Dude has some houses. I feel like he’s got spare money for you. I will inquire.

If this show sells to somebody, then at some point we’d spend quality time in Seattle for production. But before that we’d probably go up there for other stuff. I dunno, man, I keep plowing but I have largely ceased to get my hopes up about anything. I’m not one bit superstitious but this business kinda makes me feel like anything I touch turns to shit. On the other hand, if I take a step back and look objectively, the lines seem to be converging toward breakthrough. So I dunno. I think I’m just exhausted.

I don’t have any special beef with Bopst other than annoyance at how he’s always acted like the big fish in Richmond’s tiny pond. But, seriously dude, what a dumbshit.

I would like to read some of that Ruffin & Payne stuff sometime.

About Julie.  It just means that at some point the cancer will kill her and that its progress won’t be impeded by further treatment.  The timeline (ugh, as if there’s a “timeline") is unclear.  3 months? 6 months? 2 years?  See what I mean?</br></br>

And yeah, the regular fucking shit.  Julie is currently so-so, but it just changes all the time.  She was lucid and upright when I saw her yesterday.

Miriam’s been reading about who fled Germany and when.  One conclusion she’s come to is that if you’re in a vulnerable population like hers, go sooner rather than later.  And like, way sooner.  When people are still saying you’re crazy.  I can’t go.  Not with the kids.  Oh and having $0.

<b> Nov 29, 2016, at 4:30 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I have learned a lot about the varied requirements to emigrate with a dog. Some countries are real dicks about it. Everyone thinks Iceland is so great, but I say no.

At first it was pretty rough. The dread was intense. I got off Facebook and social media other than Instagram. I only just started reading news headlines again. It was the dread combined with the involuntary empathic overload. 

Best thing I have read so far: http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival/ 

The author’s first rule: Believe the autocrat. Don’t rationalize that he’s exaggerating and will moderate his behavior. Her sixth rule: Remember the future. Nothing lasts forever.

All that on top of the usual struggles has been challenging. Presumably it will only get worse. But it’s also possible that my work situation will improve, which could alleviate some of the short-term stress. 

I’m reading a bit about historical autocratic regimes, trying to make note of the turning points so I’ll recognize them if they happen here. And I’m trying to have plans for both resistance and escape, should either be warranted.

Am I paranoid? Boy I wish I could believe that.

<b> Nov 30, 2016, at 2:20 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Sensible preparation, indeed. We already assembled go-bags in case of earthquake but now we’re ramping up that prep.

I would like to hear more about Miriam’s findings. It’s hard for me to tell what this situation most resembles. Germany? Yugoslavia? Italy? I haven’t done enough reading yet but months and months ago we were discussing possible outcomes and some European dudes told one of our friends not to laugh at DT because they had once laughed at the clownish buffoons who sought election in Yugoslavia (I think it was) but those clowns wound up winning. And then rounding people up. And then killing them and dumping them in mass graves. And starting civil wars. 

There are a bunch of variables that differ from those situations. But there are also a lot of similar constants. I go back and forth. Hence, the reading and looking for signs.

It would not be a simple process to leave. (Money / place / dog / next steps / destination?) But I’m not above pulling the plug, or taking a sudden “extended vacation,” should things go south. We’re close to broke but we could muster a few bucks. 

But first we plan to resist. We’d probably be among the last type to be threatened. 

I’m glad you’re helping with the kids. The whole thing just feels massive and unthinkable. I don’t know what it would be but if you need something don’t be afraid to holler.</br></br>

<b> Dec 18, 2016, at 5:11 PM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I’m really glad it struck your interest.  There are so many weird bits here and there. There’s a lot I don’t know.

The children all wound up strange, stunted.  My guess is that this had to do with being removed from their home in India to a very austere Methodist boarding school in Ohio.  And who knows what else.  

All of the children but Edith were homely.  They all had dark hair and brown eyes.  Edith had lighter hair and blue eyes and was pretty.  I think Eleanor was jealous of Edith.  Edith supplanted Eleanor as their father’s favorite. For all I know later on Eleanor might have been jealous of Edith’s ability to get pregnant. Jealousy may have been central to Eleanor’s relationship with Edith.

Eleanor never seemed like a mature adult.  She seemed psychologically young.  She couldn’t conceive.  Her crazy sister of whom she’s jealous has had a baby the family considers deeply scandalous.  Eleanor takes Edith’s baby.  Looks noble for having done it.

I wonder if the reason she wanted to keep the big secret was because she was so jealous of Edith and consequently so overwhelmed with shame about her jealousy and her mistreatment of Edith.  She was the kind of woman for whom not talking about something made it unreal.</br></br>

I HAZ A BOAN
HANDZ OFF MY BULL PEEN
UR NEXT

[File not included]

They were all dumb so I gave up.

This was Angus’s Christmas present, along with a new bunny. (He gutted the old bunny. I think this is his fifth.)

Alison just got over the Winter Ass Flu. That was a good time. Not even sure it was flu, but there was yarfing (yell-barfing) and assplosions. She went to Portland over New Year’s to meet two babies of cousins. Babies are filthy. I blame them.

Still poor. And Alison almost got fired because her boss is an entitled narcissistic prick. Long story short: I’m pitching a show with Scott Teems that’s a murder mystery set in the early Seattle music scene, Seth is from Seattle, Alison’s job is (in part) to find new material but she didn’t bring him this project because a) Seth has bailed on two projects I had with him, b) he’s a mediocre director, and c) he has a TV deal with Sony whom I do not want to deal with again because they suck. But Scott shares a manager with Seth and the manager told Seth’s partner about the project — against our express wishes — and Seth threw a hissy fit and threatened to fire Alison. I talked him down but it was insanely stressful and he is a fucking asshole.

So 2017 is coming up aces thus far.

I guess that was actually 2016 but you know what I mean.

There are a couple of things that could become money soon. I’ve said that so many times now that I don’t have any further thoughts on the matter.

We went up to wine country above Santa Barbara for a couple days after Christmas. That was actually great. No plans, just lounging. A lot of stuff was closed but it didn’t matter. We stayed in a nice little hipster motel in a tiny town and sat around the fire pit with the dog. Met other vacationing hipsters and their dogs. Ate and drank. Sexed. It was enjoyable. 

Also had our Xmas Eve cocktail party, which we do for all the orphans when we’re in town for Xmas. That’s always fun. Thankfully I didn’t get too hammered. I don’t really like cocktails, which helps. Scotch, dry red wine, a beer or two — that’s my speed. I will forever be grateful to Trader Joe’s for carrying surprisingly decent super cheap house-brand shiraz and scotch. They’re good people.

I’ve been dicking around with music more lately but the thing I want to do hasn’t quite jelled (gelled?) in my mind’s ear yet. Trying to synthesize my strengths into something new and minimal and melodic but heavy, but heavy without guitars. I’m trying to make something that sounds more like the future, less like boring ass rock music. I might be the wrong guy for this job, not sure.

What are the happenings of late in your vicinity?</br></br>

<b> Jan 15, 2017, at 8:02 AM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Geez.  I had no idea that Alison’s boss was a jerk.  For some reason, in my head, you were all one happy family.  Did I ever have reason to believe that? I’m sorry to hear that she has to work with a narcissist.  They’re so draining to be around.  Is there an exit strategy?

You’d think a guy who made HORRIBLE BOSSES would be more self-aware. But here we are. He’s pleasant enough outside of work but he’s a micromanager and always sure he’s the smartest guy in the room. He thinks he’s this magnanimous guy but he’s a bully. It’s the worst combination. There’s no way to talk to him about it. You may have had your impression based on the cool Christmas gifts he gave us in past years (Sonos speakers), but that has stopped. And it was the one act of generosity all year. There’s an exit strategy but it’s complex and multilayered. Involves Alison setting meetings with powerful people to prospect for open jobs, which aren’t advertised anywhere. I’m hopeful something will work out. But the other variable is whether I can sell something, which would give us a lot more breathing room financially. It’s possible.

That vacation sounds nice.  It’s my dream to spend Christmas every year in a non-christian country, where nobody sees anything special about December 25.  I am completely certain that I’ve never been to a “little hipster hotel.”  

http://www.rememberthealamomotel.com/

The gold standard for “hipster hotel” would be the Ace Hotel chain, but they’re overpriced and somewhat annoying and definitely catnip for douches. That said, you can drink in their pools. This place was perfect because it was cheap and styley, in a place that isn’t overrun, and it had the sweet fire pit. We actually met another couple with a dog who live a block away from us. 

WAIT.  What? Trader Joe’s SCOTCH? My liver is happy that’s not sold in Virginia.

Yeah buddy. Like all TJ branded stuff, it’s Not Bad. Nothing to serve fancy friends but for $10 / bottle, totally fine.

Man, that less like boring-ass rock thing.  Yes.  It’s surprisingly difficult, isn’t it?  I know for certain that I don’t have it in me.  Seems like a solid goal, though.  Let me know how that progresses.

It’s interesting to me how since my creative efforts have been pointed toward writing, it’s so much harder to get into the music zone. I guess it becomes a matter of Where Do I Start? I have ideas in mind but they’re vague. More textural than specific melodies. In a way, I’ve embraced this, because I wanted to sort of purge myself of all the musical habits I’d accumulated — playing the same kind of chords, doing the same kind of songs, etc. And it’s kind of fun to feel like I’m learning how to do this all over again. But of course my efforts at this simplicity are hampered by knowing a lot, still. 


I’m not sure what to say about the goings on here.  Julie is very unwell, but it’s not because of cancer.  I think it’s psychiatric.  She never learned to take care of herself in that way, and it’s a shit show.   I don’t have the heart to explain further.  Other than that, I don’t know.  My life is stagnant in every domain I can think of.  People have this view that if one works on one’s issues one can always make progress, but it’s not true.  Sometimes all the meds and therapy and whatnot just keeps one from drowning.  But I’m barely even complaining.  

I so wish I had something helpful to say.

This is fantastic. His absolute joy at destroying the offending materials. Nothing is funnier than a little dog acting tough. Best part: his growling slowed down.

Yesterday we took Angus on a hike to this waterfall nearby. Really easy hike but it just rained here and there’s a lot of water to cross. Angus had a blast splashing around, gnawing sticks, leaping off rocks, generally acting like a wild dog. It’s amazing how much happiness dogs can provide. I have a friend who doesn’t like dogs, which is his only discernible flaw, really, and I try to explain how much love and happiness having a dog brings into my life.

Except when he’s being a little shit, of course.</br></br>

If I remember correctly, the woman in the red [REDACTED] shirt was Desiree and her husband was Benjamin. He cheated on her and is now married with two kids with someone else. So I’m glad you tipped the scale in Desiree’s direction a little. I think that breakup was gnarly. We actually just saw Desiree and her current beau in San Diego. She seems super happy and they’re pondering a move down there. 

Alison got a text from her coworker to schedule “a chat” after work today. So maybe she’s getting fired? No idea. Alison wouldn’t mind. I would, because she keeps the boat afloat. But I’m supposed to get a check for a job sometime soon (PLEASE GOD) so maybe it wouldn’t be an emergency. It wouldn’t be fun though.

Otherwise, the hustle continues. Will I ever get a break? Check back here periodically.

Angus needs a bath in the worst way. It’s just such an ordeal though.

We just saw GET OUT. It was super good. I mostly don’t like scary movies but this was fantastic. Highly recommended should you have the opportunity.</br></br>

<b> Mar 24, 2017, at 12:17 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I legit LOL’d. “That doesn’t sound like music to me.” The whole Katy Perry thing was fantastic. The tone went from Eitzel trying not to laugh to Eitzel actually fired up. Now in the YouTube sidebar the first suggested video is “Grace Zabriskie talks with Mark Eitzel,” and if I’m not mistaken, that’s Laura Palmer’s crazy mom, so I pretty much have to watch that one. There’s another one where Nadya Ginsburg talks with Eitze but that confuses me because I know her from around but did not have the impression that she’s famous or anything. I know she does comedy, does some Madonna impersonation or something. L.A. is weird, I dunno.

So the Alison Job Saga: the aforementioned “chat” was about her co-worker telling her in confidence that she’s quitting. Actually, she said she’s “getting a divorce” from Seth. She called it “an abusive relationship.” Which is 100% accurate. Alison was relieved and happy for her because Mary (the co-worker) is so fear-driven and codependent that this is a huge step. It took Mary a while to break the full situation to Seth, who tends to go ballistic. His reps basically offered her the moon to stay, because Seth is a big cash cow for them and he’s useless without her. But she’s not, thank God. She’s pregnant and due end of May and I think it gave her the perspective she needed to get out.

But so anyway, Alison had already been looking for a new job but this gave her the cover she needed to be overt about it. Which is a relief, no one wants Seth to blackball them. Seth was probably going to restructure the company anyway because he’s severly overworked and unhealthy. Though clearly he had no idea his company, i.e. Mary, was going away. Anyway now Alison's a strong candidate for a similar job (with better title and presumably pay) with Jim Parson’s company. He’s the main guy on Big Bang Theory, which neither of us have ever watched as it seems so not our thing, but everyone around town swears he’s a great guy with good taste. He wants to produce more highbrow stuff through his company. And the exec she’d be working with seems great. It’s a company of entirely gay men so she’s pitching herself as bringing the female voice that’s needed. There’s a whole hiring process that involves phoner, meeting with exec, meeting with Jim, writing sample notes on scripts, submitting other scripts to demonstrate her taste, etc. She’s got a bunch of industry people putting in the good word for her and such. She wants it, bad. But she’s already happier in life knowing the reign of Seth terror is coming to an end.

I still have not received that damn paycheck. I’m told it’s coming next week. Argh. Otherwise, trying not to be angsty about the six active projects I have out in the world that aren’t landing.

We have punted on Angus’s bath. It’s bad. Really bad. He smells like dog nast. We have to give him a bath. 

I submit that this is one of the finest album covers of our time. Don’t know if you’re familiar with Thundercat but he’s this kooky bass player who currently works with the jazz guys who do Kendrick Lamar’s records but he also DJs and played in Suicidal Tendencies. Here he looks like pissed-off Miles Davis rising out the Mekong Delta to kill a muthafucka. And it’s entitled “Drunk.” Brilliant.

I mention it because I saw it in the YouTube sidebar.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> The Grace Zabriskie one is the best.  She reminds me of Collee as an old lady.  I came across those videos while trying to learn Gratitude Walks.  The middle section of that song—the weird instrumental break that leads to the bridge—is really fucked up and hard to decipher.  It’s almost like a random string of chords.  There’s lots of using 9ths as roots of chords and other similar tom foolery.

Jobs, money.  I hope Alison gets that other job.  Do guys like Seth start off like dicks or does “Hollywood” do that to them?

I also hope that damn paycheck has arrived.  I don’t know what else to say about that.  “I like money.” 

Hung out with Roz on Sunday.  She says hi.  She’s the same.

About a month ago I received a gift card from an anonymous benefactor in the mail.  The memo note read, “ANONYMOUS,” which made me think that its sender wanted to remain...anonymous.  Obviously I wanted to honor that.  But then I saw “Robert Massey” and your address in the upper lefthand corner of the piece of paper onto which the card was glued and that put me in a bit of a quandary.  If you had wanted to give me that money anonymously, maybe I should let you think you had, and I could just tell you about it without telling you that I knew you were the source.  But then, when I went to use the card and I saw that on its memo line it said, “Dirty Sexy Money,” I realized that if you were trying to hide your identity, you weren’t trying very hard.

All of which is a preamble to my saying thank you.  Maybe you have an idea of how much I needed that, but to be clear, I needed it a lot.  And I know it’s not like you’re rolling in cash yourself.  So far I’ve used some of that money to get an overdue oil change, lots of groceries, a new air conditioner filter, and gasoline which has allowed me to keep Ubering.  I haven’t had a haircut in 6 months, and will use a bit more to get that done—I’m beginning to look like one of those 40-something guys who grows his hair long in a sad effort to hide his growing bald spot.  I also used some to pay overdue bills, which has meant that I haven’t had service disruptions to phone, electric, or gas.

Last month I got your gift card and sold Red, which together gave me $700 more than I normally have.  Just that amount let me take several large gulps of air, and lo and behold, not wondering where meals would come from have left me feeling a little more resilient / less crazy than normal.  

So thank you.  That was just a perfect act of kindness.

Johnsburg, yes.  I love that song.  remember listening to it on repeat while taking a bath in my attic apartment in 1996.  A lot of times songs feel like they’ve had their lyrical content stretched out to make the song last 3 minutes.  The other thing about that song is that it’s so specific and personal that it’d be hard to cover credibly.</br></br>

I think I’ve mentioned how Seth took a turn for the asshole-ish over the last couple years, culminating in genuinely oppressive bullying behavior. Long story short, his entire company quit. It’s all being cloaked in this idea that he needs a break from the pace to sort out his health and family and stuff. But his producing partner Mary felt the same as Alison and she left (diplomatically). I think he doesn’t realize just how fucked he is. He is helpless without her. Interesting times.

But so Alison landed a job working for Jim Parsons (Big Bang Theory, Hidden Figures). Similar company setup except they genuinely want to produce quality socially conscious stuff, not just pay lip service a la Seth. She jumped two title rungs to become Vice President of Development. And she got a significant pay bump. And they seem to truly want her to exercise all her skill to bring in good projects. It’s amazing. She starts tomorrow, and time will tell how it plays out, but it feels like a new day around here, I can tell you.

Good timing too. I have a little bit of paying work but the other paying opportunities are still swirling around in the ether. Good thing the lady’s kicking ass.

I’m not on Facebook anymore but maybe you saw Alison's photos we took on vacation (or I can send). Our vacation M.O. is this: When we get a few bucks, pay for tickets in advance, since we’re usually broke again by the time the trip comes around. And we always wanted to go to Morocco. We saw super cheap tix to Spain, so we flew there and then hopped over to Morocco. Among the highlights was Chefchaouen, the blue city (Google it). After that we went to Fez. The medinas in both cities are very different but both kind of overwhelming and fascinating. Crazy contrasts between filth and beauty. Then back to Spain for access to ham and rose. 

It’s weird. After years and years of struggle and disappointment and periods of privation, both of us are always a little uneasy when good things happen. Like the other shoe must logically drop. Except that that’s totally bogus superstition, of course. Suffering is never far away but it isn’t any quid pro quo thing. Every day we recount our blessings and express gratitude. Mostly to make sure we’re aware of what a privilege it is to enjoy things at all. Which is to say that we want to spread it around. So don’t be shy when you’re hard up. We don’t really think of the money or things in our care as belonging to us in any entitled or permanent way. 

Also, that haiku book has given us joy valued in the six figures, probably.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> That is fantastic news about Alison, and I’m glad she’s out of that toxic situation. Sometimes good things happen!  Let me know how it goes for her, and please give her my congratulations.

I’m not seeing those photos.  I wanna see.  Sounds incredible.  

Thanks for what you said about speaking up when I’m hard up.  I’ll probably have to take you up on that.

Have you been doing music stuff?  Since you started relearning everything from the ground up, I mean?

“The way I make music is by observing, reporting how I feel, and mixing an element of therapy,” he says. “A lot of times, what I say on songs is pretty literal. I don’t dance around it by reading Greek mythology. We’re not having sex? Then this is terrible.”</br></br>

 / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Hello.

For every day that I procrastinate, the thing I’m not doing gets 10 times harder to do.  That’s why this email is arriving now. Shame ruins everything!

Here’s a movie idea:

Nice neighborhood at night. Camera is moving down the street.  A drone creeps into the frame from the lefthand side. The camera stays with the drone as it suction cups itself onto a window.  Pistons make the window open.  Drone flips backwards then flies through the open window.  It’s loud enough to rouse the man whose bedroom it’s in.  He sits upright.  The drone fires three shots into his head and then reverses its course, closing the window on its way out.  it flies out over the ocean, lands on the water, and sinks.

The End (because I don’t know what’s next.)

***

I don’t listen to music anymore.  Have I mentioned that I intermittently lose my senses of smell and taste?  It seems like I lost interest in listening to music, too.  I like making it, but even stuff I used to hold very dear just sounds blah. I decided an hour ago that I’m going to try to combat it. A regimen of forced music a little at a time.

Fuzzy sends his greetings.  He’s trying to get me to play now that I’ve sat down. The other night in my writing group I imagined a physical contest between Fuzzy and a bald eagle.  Fuzzy won of course.

Am no longer driving for Uber.  They’ve recruited so many drivers here that there wasn’t enough work to go around.  Also they’re just horrible. But now I need a job again. 

At long last I’m making a catalog of all of my Ryan McGinness stuff.  Partially to make it available to academics who write about him, partly to let some museums know that it exists.  He said it has “no financial value right now, but very high cultural value.”  The thing is that he’s right. Still, imagine asserting that some creative endeavor from when you were 20 possessed very high cultural value.

Recently I had a crush on someone, but then it went away.

Have been thinking a lot about songs, trying to define what I think makes a good song.  Mostly in terms of lyrics, but also making a distinction between songs that require electricity to perform or are more soundscape-like vs those that an individual can perform with one acoustic instrument.  Like, most of The Unforgettable Fire fits into the soundscapey category when compared to, I don’t know, This Land is Your Land or something.

Isn’t it weird to think that until a little over 100 years ago if you heard music you were within earshot of its maker?  I mean, what must that have been like?  You must have pined for the village dance or whatever.  Also no deafening drum kits, which must have been nice.

Julie just had clean 6-month scans.  

Thank you, belatedly, for your description of your Spain and Morocco trip.  The 4 hour meal sounds incredible.  And all the beauty.  And the spooky 14th century hotel/mausoleum.   I couldn’t use the link to the pictures, but I’ve seen several on Instagram.

Where to next?</br></br>

It was cool for a while here but now it’s hot again.

I’m playing a show in October with my friend Liza.

Fuzzy thinks it’s dinnertime, but it’s not quite.  Soon.

Fuzzy thinks that dinner is “the tits.”

What a weird expression that is, “the tits.” I guess it means something’s good, like because everyone likes boobs?

Have been listening obsessively to a podcast called “No Such Thing as a Fish.” It’s british, like “the tits."

Watched Armageddon for the first and last time.  I was open minded, but it was worse than I expected.

Not much to report, really.  Reading. Working on songs. Managed to buy a pair of shoes. 

Slightly less sane at present than my recent norm.  Long story.  Not too bad, more a nuisance like a runny nose.

What’s news with you?

With Alison?

With Angus?</br></br>

<b> Oct 10, 2017, at 5:24 PM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Hey Bob,

Sorry for the long silence if it has been one.

It’s muggy as hell here and still in the middle 80s. We had a few days of nascent autumn before summer returned.

That series Homeland is shooting here. My friend Rachel is the script supervisor.  I might be an extra. Hoping to be a bad guy.

Fuzzy recently growled at a neighbor—one I like—who bent down to say hello to him.  The neighbor wisely withdrew, but not before Fuzzy tried to pee on the guy’s foot.

What’s news there? How’s Alison? And Angus?

I’m playing a show soon, and while I mostly feel good about it, I’m haunted by every Rigs of Dad I’ve ever seen.

<b> Oct 11, 2017, at 2:57 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Did you go to Atlanta? Did you eat shrimp and grits? I rather like Atlanta.

Much of California is on fire at the moment. Yesterday I saw smoke rising over the hilltop so I walked over the hill to see if I needed to pack the dog in the car and flee. It was just two houses on fire, which seems fairly manageable considering. Still, that shit was intense. No one was hurt, thankfully. About two dozen emergency vehicles. Of course the fire took out two lovely old Craftsmen bungalows instead of the nasty stucco box apartment next door. I guess it’s not a good idea to wish that on any building though.

You know, somehow I’ve watched every season of Homeland. It’s so far removed from what it once was. But I still like it. The good news is that you could totally be a bad guy on that show. There are a lot of civilized, educated, evil motherfuckers in those stories. That would be dope. I would watch that so hard.

The big dog news on our block is that the neighbors with the annoying-ass beagle who never shuts up are finally training him. Incredible. It’s been years. That dog barks at wind. His name is Chico. He’s probably an okay dog inside the fence but he is the bane of this four block radius. Some new people moved in next door to Chico and must have complained. Thank God.

Also Alison and I, while separately walking Angus, have both met Red Dog, the new dog of this woman Magda who lives up the street. Magda is a photographer who is known for a couple of things: 1) landing a Bruce Springsteen album cover, and 2) being naked in a lot of her own photos. http://magdalenawosinska.com/ (This seems like news you can use.) Alison and Angus met her and Red Dog and Alison just got a massive girl crush on her. She is known to be “very cool.” She has a fancy restored GTO that she parks on the street as well as a black Audi whose license plate reads: BLKSABF. I stared at that plate for a year on dog walks trying to figure it out. “Black Saab F? But that’s an Audi?” Finally the other day it hit me: Black Sabbath. She plays bass in a heavy rock band when she’s not taking pictures. I guess she’s very RVA, if it were RVA to actually be successful at things. Anyway, Red Dog is very cool and likes Angus and so now Alison has made it a mission to befriend Magda. Also, Magda apparently has a place out in Joshua Tree so I think that might be what’s driving all this.

Once Angus refused to sleep in a crate, he began to sneak up on the yellow comfy chair at night. Then we got him a small dog bed to go beside the couch in the living room, in a tight cave-like space between couch and wall. He liked that. But he always wanted to sleep in the bedroom and we wouldn’t let him. Too noisy. But then we realized we could take his collar off at night and it was fine. But then we got him a big overstuffed dog bed (on sale at the hipster pet store in the neighborhood called Rosie Baby Bunny Bean Dip or something, I can never remember) so he slept on it in the office. Then we got a rug for the office and he liked that better, so we moved the big dog bed into our bedroom. And now he waits until we’re both getting ready for bed, lays down on the overstuffed dog bed until we get in bed ourselves, then he leaves. Such a weirdo. And he cycles around among the beds all night long.

I feel you about Rigs of Dad. Haunting is precisely the word. It may have ruined me. I may now have to become a DJ. When is your show?</br></br>

We don’t really have a sense over here of how vast and horrible the fires are. I see the images, hear the numbers, but it’s like a hurricane someplace else. It must be the first thing on everyone’s mind there. When Charlottesville happened, it felt like doomsday here in Richmond. It was surprising how people elsewhere reacted—they perceived it as terrible, but it didn’t seem to strike them as an existential threat the way it struck a lot of us in Richmond. We felt visceral fear. So I imagine the fires feel very different there than they do here.

I couldn’t get in to Homeland. I was obsessively watching The Americans when I gave Homeland a shot, and by comparison the latter seemed kind of silly. It’s probably a good show, but The Americans is truly great…and also gave me my fill of espionage entertainment. Nonetheless, I’m hoping to get an extra spot on Homeland.  I hear that it pays well.

Please write a screenplay about my uncle the NSA spy. Make him a lust killer. Great cover.

I did look up Magda.  Geez. 

That’s funny about Angus cycling through his beds.  I wonder if he’s anxious about them or if he just feels like the lord of the manor.

Friends leant me money to get a guitar.  I figured it wouldn’t be my all-time, forever guitar, but I lucked out.  It’s a Martin all mahogany jumbo. It sounds a little like Nick Drake’s guitar, I guess, low and balanced. It’s hard to stop playing it. My show is Saturday night. I’m telling myself that it’s a little less Rigs if you play unamplified and sing songs about loss and death and insanity. It’s not like I’m in Poon Squad playing an open mic at Twisters on a Wednesday night. Right? Right?

Life has been more tolerable than normal lately.  For the time being I’m saying to myself that the damage may run so deep that being in a primary love relationship might be too tall an order.  But rather than depressing me, that thought feels compassionate and accepting. I’d rather be stable without a partner than always lurching towards or away from a woman. The change has come about through my friendship with Valley, my writing teacher. It’s a miracle that I’ve been able to form friendships and maintain them for years with people like her or you or any number of other people who care about me. Did you know that almost all the serial killers out there had humiliating, oversexed mothers and sadistic and absent fathers? Maybe my life is a success just simply because I did not become that. Now if I could make it pay! In the meantime, I’m going to apply for a job at Kroger.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> At the distance of a week and change I’d say it went well. The day after I went into a profound shame spiral that involved questions like, “Why have I always been such a stupid loser?” and “What makes me think it’s appropriate—talentless as I am—to perform music in front of people?”  Feedback from strangers was very positive. They’d hold my elbow and say, “Thank you. That was an incredibly nice evening.” And I’d think, “How have I fucked it all up so bad?”

But now I see that they were sincere and that they perceived it more accurately than I did. And I’m glad I did it, Rigs of Dad vibe or no.

You can see/hear it for yourself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue-G3qnWzUw&feature=youtu.be

<b> Dec 23, 2017, at 7:44 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Hey, did you get a spot on Homeland? What role did you play? I hope you played a Saudi terrorist.

Did you tell me about your NSA uncle? I can’t remember.

We just gave Angus a bone that looks like someone killed a Stegosaurus and took the shin bone. It’s huge. He’s guarding it in the yard now. He didn’t seem to know how to bury it. He just scooped dirt on it with his nose. Sometimes dogs forget how to dog.

We’re going to New Orleans for the coming week. As you know, we don’t do family holidays. New Orleans is relatively easy and inexpensive and there’s yummy food and booze and music. And who knows what else. I’ve only spent like a day there. Alison’s never been down south at all except for Atlanta. 

I think I’ve mentioned that Mike Halverson has befriended David Yow from the Jesus Lizard. Who is sweet as pie. So the other night they played a reunion gig here and Mike tried to get me to go but I couldn’t. However, he did send me a photo of Yow kind of stretching out his dick over the top of his jeans, like a kid playing with a toy or something. It’s perhaps unseemly for a middle aged man but then again it’s what the fans expect. Nay, demand. Can’t really unsee it, though.

I have spared you from that sight. You’re welcome.

What ho?</br></br>

<b> Jan 19, 2018, at 8:58 AM / Timothy McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> No spot on Homeland. They fired my friend Rachel, the script supervisor for the bullshittiest reason, and I couldn’t bear to work for them when they called. That production took the Virginia film credits on the basis of hiring X number of locals. They hired ‘em then systematically fired most. The lady in charge of that show sounded harder to work with than most of the TV people who’ve worked around here over the last several years. I hated to deny my public on the basis of my scruples, but my scruples are why they (my public) love me.

I’m sorry it’s taken me til now to write this. Now that I’m writing it it seems easy to do, but before it seemed impossible.

On the other hand maybe I just needed time to process the David Yow image.

Shit here is pretty blah. Christmas was shitty. I spent a lot of the day with Julie and family. The whole time I was looking at her thinking how this is likely our last Christmas together and how next Christmas it’d probably just be me, Hunter, and the kids. Then I went home and had this weird dreamlike state during which I felt just bruisingly sad on my father’s behalf, like as bad as he was when we were kids, it was horrible to think that his daughter was going to die without him knowing it. But that is what’s going to happen. Then I went to my jewish friends’ annual Christmas thing, drank one martini, and had to leave because my brain just kind of fell apart. So that was sad.

On the other hand, I went to my friend Bird’s for New Year’s, and one of her friends was married to Eric Axelson, who was there. That was neat. It was maybe 10 degrees that night.

Last night I saw Neko Case. I went with Julie. She needed to be able to sit, so we went up to the balcony. She had a terrible time getting up the stairs—like nearly fainting bad—and though we got up there eventually, it was the first time something about the timing of all of this hit me right in the face. She wasn’t sure if it was chemo or the cancer in her lungs. I had a hard time attending to Neko Case which is usually not a problem.

Otherwise I am treading water. Kind of in a “life’s purpose is to be a good sport about life’s purpose” phase, which is to say fairly depressed. 

But Fuzzy remains the greatest companion of all time. That thing you said about Angus’s giant bone reminded me of when I first gave Fuzz Nylabones when I brought him home. He’d run the circumference of the apartment with the bone dangling like a cigarette with the most abjectly worried look on his phase like why have you burdened me with this responsibility? 

Thanks for staying up with me with that email the other day. Sometimes it feels like too much to write, but it invariably makes me feel better about things.

Give my fond regards to Alison and Angus.</br></br>

<b> Jan 19, 2018, at 2:26 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So many feelings…

Let me punt on the big ones for a sec. I’ve been meaning to watch your show on YouTube but it got lost in the shuffle. Watching now. It’s really good — in ways expected and unexpected. You do this thing that I really appreciate which is to underplay. Lots of space in your strumming, in your singing. 

It’s funny, I’d forgotten your singing voice a little. The ways it’s like and unlike your speaking voice. I really really like the lyrics here. Really timeless phrases punctuated with unexpected twists. That’s some good stuff. 

How much did you have to rehearse to get back in the saddle? When I was doing stuff like this I would put off rehearsing until like a few days before the show and then I would rehearse myself obsessively for hours and hours, just to get the finger chops back where I didn’t have to think about them. And I’d spend like an hour before shows just doing vocal warmups — which were mandatory or else I’d feel constrained and miss notes. And then sometimes I’d still need a song or two to get into it during the show. You seem to come out of the gate strong. I always wonder about other people’s showman magic — like did you play your entire set at home before you came so you could sashay in and slay? Ha. I totally do that shit sometimes. 

I’m really enjoying this. I wish I’d been there for the actual set.

I miss Eric Axelson. What a sweet guy. Can’t understand a damn word he says half the time. Love him.

It’s impossble to imagine what that’s like with Julie. For you. For Hunter. For the kids. For her. I sit here and try for even just a minute and I can’t. The slow dread, the exhaustion. I want to help somehow and know that I’m years behind all of you.

People just laughed at the opening of The Valley of Bliss. I bet they don’t think you’re serious. Boy will they be surprised.

Angus’s giant bone has disappeared somewhere in the yard. He has rediscovered the tennis ball. He gets excited about it for around 1.5 minutes, or two-to-three bounces, and then it’s like he forgets why he liked it. We are waiting for a little more rain to come because then snow will fall in the mountains nearby and we can take him up there (about a 20 minute drive) to do some ripping in the snow. He loves the living shit out of it.

Out of curiosity do you know the name of the Homeland lady you would have worked for? So I can avoid her.

Man, the guitar in Moonstones. Those chords. The harmonics… Damn, man. I’ve never had such effortless chops as that in my whole damn life. You fucker.

Joni MItchell is jealous of that song. Not me, though, nosir, Mr. Fucker.

Oh and then it gets better, fine. The Honey and the Lye. I gotta say, this whole experience seems utterly natural and unforced and like where you should be. So there.

God I love that little guitar line at 30:15.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Listen, you can’t know what your feedback about that set means to me. I was ambivalent about doing it.  On the one hand, I’d written all these new songs and had an organic desire to share them. On the other hand: Rigs of Dad. I practiced the whole set two or three times a day for the month before. I tried to improve my singing by watching lots of vocal technique tips on YouTube. I played the guitar bits without singing and recorded them so I could sing to the recordings in my car. So I put in a lot of time.  I tend to believe strongly in the songs themselves, less strongly in my guitar playing, and almost not at all in my singing. Overall I felt as prepared as I could be.

But during the show I was unaccountably nervous, almost locked up. I couldn’t manage my breath like I could at home. I heard my singing and was convinced that it was worse than my singing had been before I decided to try. It became difficult to connect with what I was saying. 

As soon as the show was over I felt okayish about it. The unsolicited feedback from strangers was very kind. But by the next morning I was convinced I’d humiliated myself. I was a 45 year old man looking to days of yesteryear, singing in an idiom whose time was past…an imitation of his irrelevant heroes. And so on.

The shame took two months to burn off. It was not replaced by a desire to repeat the experience. But I probably will anyway.

In any case, having a friend like you who I know wouldn’t bullshit me compliment the very things I cared most about in this thing has been a pretty big shot in the arm. So thank you!

Homeland. The shitty producer was Lesli Linka Glatter. My friend Rachel has been doing this awhile. She came up working for Roger Corman in the 80s and did script supervision out there for a long time before moving here with her then-husband. She’s worked with some insufferable pricks throughout all that, and I think she’d say this lady was just about the worst.

Speaking of work, you said you’re doing  full time thing now? What is it? And what else is news?

Thanks again for all that feedback.</br></br>

<b> Apr 23, 2018, at 9:43 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Mmmm rose.

Let’s see…

The dog is just happy as shit. Although he was pretty needy today in a way that made me think he was sad about something. Alison came home and was actually sad and decided Angus knew she was feeling down across the many miles. It’s not that far-fetched.

On the whole our life is very good. However — and I haven’t told anyone this so keep it on the DL for now — we’ve been trying to get pregnant, and in fact Alison did get pregnant, but it didn’t take. Not viable, per Friday’s doctor visit. So now we’re in the strange zone of waiting for it to flush out on its own. And she’d been so full of joy about the whole thing but now she’s fighting the blues. Understandably. I mean, we both know this happens more often than not. But you just feel what you feel. My feelings are more like a gray haze of blargh. Hers are pretty sharp and intense, I think. 

We weren’t sure if we could get pregnant on our own, so there’s a bit of silver lining. 

The work is better than ever. Which is a big plus, though does little to address actual life situations. Scott Teems and I sold a show to a network. So that puts me in the game, professionally. Everyone is being super congratulatory but my feelings haven’t really spiked in any way. I’m not sure how to read that. Probably a weird cocktail of caution, having been burned, irritation that it took this long, and the remaining distance to go before it actually gets on the air. But I will get a big paycheck before long, which may help it sink in.

Also still working on the Mike Judge show about funk bands. It’s very funny.

The Julie situation just crushes me into the dirt. I can’t formulate words about it.

At first I thought you meant Hunter rather than Harrison. Either way, amazing news. I’d like to hear how that came about. Harrison strikes me as some kind of extraordinarily super guy.

Faith life. In a word: scattered. Our little weirdo church, Tribe, dissolved. We haven’t felt like looking for another church. I’ve kind of been ruined for anything like “normal” church. I basically will never again attend a church that owns a building. My actual faith is basically pretty steady. I think a lot of the trappings of the evangelical training are burning off. I basically cringe whenever I read about any loudmouthed religious motherfucker asserting his opinion about anything. I’ve come to sense that there are some very very very basic core realities but almost everything about the American Protestant paradigm is upside down. So much hubbub about sex, so little actual care for the weak or needy or hungry or hurting. Once, many moons ago, when I’d just moved to DC and was dating Mary Macinnis, I applied for a job I found in the paper at a publishing company. During the very unusual interview I learned that the guy who ran it had gone to seminary in the 60s and marched in the Civil Rights movement and so on. But he said a thing about faith that has stuck with me to this day: “You gotta roll your own.” That grows more profound to me with every year. I don’t even remember that guy’s name.

I believe in Jesus. By which I sort of mean: I believe Jesus was the most punk rock motherfucker who ever walked, and also somehow God. But everything else is pretty negotiable. I for sure feel like the whole radical notion of grace is WAY WAY WAY more expansive than anyone is comfortable with.

Alison and I periodically find ourselves roped into experiences that we can only describe thusly: “Welp, that’s one more supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again.”

BTW, I know you guys are going through it. So if you need whatever — money, assistance, booze, prayer, phone calls — you have a blank check.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Man. I’m so sorry to hear about Alison’s miscarriage. I can only imagine what it feels like to build up so much hope then feel like it’s been taken away. I hope her pain and your gray haze become more and more tolerable.

I’m psyched about your work.  Congratulations! It’s easy to see how you’d have mixed feelings. I can especially understand the irritation part. Wouldn’t it be nice sometimes to be the kind of person who doesn’t have mixed feelings about nearly everything? What are the steps before the show would be on the air? What is the show?

I’m also psyched about the Mike Judge thing. I feel like that guy has consistently entertained me, and if he wants to do a show about funk bands, I want to watch it.

Thank you for your Faith Life Update. It’s interesting. I remember reading some contemporary catholic theologian who said the only way to be Christian anymore is to be some kind of mystic, which seems like it jibes well with “rolling your own.” Also, only joining churches that don’t own buildings seems wise. Whenever the pope or some other high ranking catholic makes noise about their sorrow for all the sexual abuse at the hands of priests, I want to tell them I will believe they’re really sorry when they sell every last thing they own including St. Peter’s and all the rest and distribute that money equitably to the poor.  I guess they could still own some office buildings.  Or they could just work from home. I do not have a faith life, per se. I suspect that love matters. As in love that = the extension of oneself for others or even for oneself.

Thank you for the blank check. If I can think of a way to ask for anything, I will. I’ve gotten fairly decent at that after lots of practice.

I’ve been reading poems at open mic nights. These are the worst kinds of things, these open mics. Rooms full of sad and angry people doing slam schtick most of the time. Dudes who get up there and transparently fish for sex with bogus sensual claptrap. This one guy, who has a bad head injury, just gets up and talks about Jesus incoherently. Some people quake with embarrassing emotion. Once every blue moon someone strives to make art instead of just ranting. Rarer still, they make art that I connect with--I’d say I sort of appreciate the work of one out every 30 readers.  But I just love it. I love communing with these people pouring their hearts out. I love how sad and weird the whole thing feels, you know, like in that small town dinner theater way. Everyone is generally extremely supportive of everyone else. When someone messes up their reading, lots of people in the audience yell encouragement like “You got this! You got this!” It’s mostly very awful writing aesthetically, but when I think what else people might do with a group of strangers on a Friday night, it seems awfully sweet that these ones come together to talk about their lives so vulnerably. Obviously, all of my poetry is excellent.

Julie’s decline is requiring me to undergo the most ruthless acts of self preservation I’ve ever managed consciously. Everyone behaves worse than normal under stress, and this stress is bringing many of Julie’s personality difficulties to the fore. I don’t know what to say except that she frequently seems like a petulant 16-year-old. This has always been true, but has been especially so during this terrible moment. I thought I was alone in feeling angry at her bad behavior, but recently had a talk with Hunter about it and learned that it’s equally hard on him. I love my sister and feel more tenderness towards her than I do towards anyone, but her immaturity frequently makes it hard to feel my tenderness untinged by real resentment. So the whole thing feels very jagged. It’s death. I do what I can to help—especially with the kids—and then I take whatever space I need to keep from going insane. So far so good.</br></br>

I like Belmont Food Shop. Not super new, not much buzz, but definitely prized by food people. Very small dining room...maybe seating for 12. 

Stella’s is upscale Greek. Nice ambience. Attracts both moms and young hip types. A mom pleasing place, I’d say. 

L’Opossum in Oregon Hill is supposedly the best place in town. I wouldn’t know because even the friends who frequently pay for my meals can’t afford it. I don’t care for possums or anything named after them. But people swear by it.

<b> Nov 4, 2018, at 12:01 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Yeah, I read every one of those letters. Just great stuff. Really makes you love the guy. 

I am totally pro-Cave but I must admit that I don’t listen to him that much. I have almost all his records though. I think maybe he’s a very good songwriter who’s just shy of actually great? Or maybe it doesn’t connect with me emotionally as much as others? I dunno. I just love that the guy has achieved all he’s achieved though. It’s a weird thing. 

I’m gonna guess that the summer situation is just worse iterations of the known phenomena? Or was there something else about it? Don’t feel like I need a play by play, just wondering. And glad things are better.

How is Julie doing? What’s the situation there? I’m so glad every time I see a post from her.

I’ve been trying to get a band to use the name Meatwheel / Meat Wheel since the 90s. I guess Meal of Poodles isn’t gonna get any takers either. Alison suggests Soft Pants. Who’s in the band? What’s the deal? I am VERY interested in this idea of only singing. I forget who I was watching play but I had the thought not long ago: Bob, your stupid problem is you tried to do too much. 

I have been resisting reading glasses. I fight on.

However, I’m kidding myself.

Shit’s okay. Good in some ways, tough in others. We’re both gainfully employed, which I hope is new trend. (If you need something, holler, we got dough for a change.) It feels good to get paid for writing scripts, after all these years of hustling. Still renting the same little bungalow (which you should come see), too good a deal to leave. We’ve been trying to get pregnant — which is a whole other email’s worth of complicated feelings — but had two miscarriages. We’ve been working with a fertility doctor to get a grasp on the situation. No drugs or procedures or anything, at this point. The overall conclusion: shit is tricky.

I’m on the record as liking the idea of having had kids, but not really being excited about the having of them — if that makes any sense. But it’s funny how thinking it’s on, then a couple months later it’s off, really fucks with one’s balance.

We’re fine, though I think it hits Alison harder than me. Which seems natural. The whole thing is just so weird though.</br></br>

<b> Nov 8, 2018, at 5:31 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I guess I think he’s a great songwriter who just doesn’t edit out his turds. Like he’ll write a basically perfect song but leave some obvious language blunder in it. Or one song will be perfect (Into My Arms) right near a stinker like Green Eyes. But I do feel like the gems are truly great. There usually schtick-free, which is maybe a clue to all that.

Summer: A year or so ago Harrison had proposed buying a building that I’d manage for a massively reduced rent. He needed to put some assets in real estate. Said he didn’t need it to make any money but couldn’t lose any. Settled on if he could get 4% annually from the rents he’d be thrilled. Was basically the most loving single thing anyone’s ever done for me. Bought the place, I moved in, did most of the renovations, he saw that he could get more rent, decided to require more than I could afford. That’s probably the blow by blow you didn’t want. Sorry. Anyway, I had to leave and had no money for security deposit or rent at a new place, no credit, etc. He lost his mind. Blew up a friendship of 26 years. I was blindsided. I fell apart but avoided dying or going to the hospital. People have helped a lot.

Julie is just kind of slowly declining. It’s sad because you can’t tell which part is the unaddressed psychiatric illness and which the cancer. She feels pretty rotten either way. It’s sad.

I’m ignoring your band name suggestions. Soft Pants has promise, though.

I hope you two have children. There aren’t a lot of people I feel that way about. I’m sorry for the stress of it. I’ve seen other friends go through it, and it’s a heartbreak.  Also, I know what you mean about liking the idea but not being excited by it. That seems sober and real.  I’m wary of would be parents who are blithely gung-ho, especially the men. 

There’s a gofundme to help with my expenses if you’re interested. I wouldn’t mention it except that what you said in your email made me feel like I could. I didn’t write the appeal and I don't administer it—two friends undertook the whole thing. Going public in this way is pretty much sickeningly vulnerability-inducing. On the one hand I don’t have much of a choice because this is the plain truth of my life, and on the other, I’m taking the step in faith that on the other side of the vulnerability is love.</br></br>

<b> Nov 14, 2018, at 2:45 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I think yours is the correct analysis of Cave. BTW, did you see his Red Hand Files from today? Three lines, hilarious.

I am basically floored by this Harrison situation. I cannot fathom it. (I can only imagine how you felt.) Shit like that scares me. That someone you wholly trust can succumb to greed or power or some self-serving impulse and utterly shut out empathy. I think that’s what happened to Alison’s old boss, who was formerly a nice decent guy. It’s the oddest thing. There’s some fear powering it all, I’m sure, but so what. Anyway, I’m so sorry that happened. That sucks. 

Next week we’re gonna go drive around a bunch of the national parks in the southwest. Zion, Bryce, some others I forgot that Alison knows. We’ve never done that. One Christmas we had an epic trip to the Grand Canyon but the west has so much. Alison’s been bugging me to lean on you to come for a visit to the west coast. (We’d float it.) I would love that but I’ve also gently been suggesting to her that you may or may not allocate resources by our priorities (meaning: to see you). But if it has appeal, it would be cool to see you. No expectation that you’d hang with us the whole time, of course. Things are crazy at the moment with the fires but it’s an amazing drive up to Big Sur, SF, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, whatever. Anyway, I throw it out there for your consideration.</br></br>

Man. I’ve just had such a strange evening. I met my friend PJ for a beer. We talked about a variety of things one of which—briefly— was Tom Waits. A couple next to us asked if we were Tom Waits fans. We got to talking. The guy half of this couple worked on Frank’s Wild Years. They were visiting from LA, touring historical sites in Virginia. He worked at Sunset Studios throughout the mid- late-80s. Worked with Mitchell Froom on my favorite Elvis Costello record, Spike. I guess maybe this kind of thing happens a lot out there, but it definitely doesn’t happen here. He also seemed to know Prince pretty well. He helped set up the studio in Paisley Park.  

I would love to visit you. I’d just love that. That sounds great. 

Harrison. I can’t quite fathom it either, and mostly I’m trying not to try to understand it. What’s the point? I hope he sees his way to trying to repair this, but I’m not gonna do it for him. At first I felt mostly sad for him as a means of survival. Now I’d like to punch him very hard in the face. Nonetheless, it’s extremely spooky to have had someone I construed as a close friend behave like that. Maybe the problem was in how I construed the friendship. Also, there is something very, very wrong with the rich. Especially the legacy rich.

<b> Dec 11, 2018, at 7:12 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> The band must be called IRON PANTS.

It has a clever double meaning, like all the best (worst) band names.

It is both heavy and practical.

The handbills draw themselves.

You know I’m right.



Also, in the typical fashion, I just learned from my sister that my mom had major surgery today for diverticulitis (perforated intestine). Apparently it went okay. She’ll be in the hospital until at least Saturday, which tells you how serious it is since new moms only get 24 hours. If my sister hadn’t randomly texted my mom this morning, neither of us would have had any idea. My anger about this is a side issue that doesn’t matter but feel free to say a prayer or light a candle for my mom’s recovery. Oh, and I also found out her husband has bladder cancer. If it weren’t all so serious I’d kick them both in the butt.

<b> Dec 14, 2018, at 2:43 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I talked to her on the phone yesterday. She was clearly drugged. The impression she gave was that she felt optimistic about her recovery, generally. But she was weepy, scared, pretty freaked out overall. In large part because of her husband Herb's cancer situation. He goes in today for a biopsy so they can formulate a prognosis. My sister looked up bladder cancer and says it's 90% curable if it's caught early. I don't know if this is early or late or what. My mom's in the hospital until at least tomorrow. I think the logistics of getting home, keeping up her care, etc. is likely pretty daunting. Plus I hear there's a foot of snow. I'm gonna call her again later today and see what else I can get her to say. As you know, she basically doesn't communicate with me unless I call her myself. I don't know why, exactly. My sister and I are pretty mystified by that. I'd guess it has to do with her overall policy of denial. We had a rocky adolescence and young adulthood, a lot of it falls on her and my dad, she doesn't want to face it, so she doesn't talk to us. I dunno. Maybe. 

Moments like this just tempt me to despair. I want a full-life do-over. But of course I would be someone else if it had gone another way. Probably. I hate it.

How are things on your end?

</br></br>

<b> Dec 14, 2018, at 6:17 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> It’s been awhile since things seemed really dark, so take with salt. I mean, this thing is something that’s been with me a long time but only periodically surfaces. I will tell you that I 100% advocate some kind of workout. If I don’t go for runs (or other exertion) the darkness tends to close in. I don’t know why. I think there’s a brain chemistry thing at work. I mean, I also tend to live up in my head, you know? 

I’d also say that having a serious pursuit (the long road to master screenwriting and break through) helps me with direction and focus. Other people find it depressing. But I need a task or goal or long exertion of will. Again, not sure why. Pretty sure it was instilled in me early, though, by the folks. I’m sure there’s all manner of unhealthy “proving my worth to my parents” kind of stuff wrapped up in it, but fuck it, I don’t have the need to dissect it. 

Weirdly, I also think that gradually cutting out insulin-producing things made a difference. I love sugar but I don’t indulge on any regular basis. I’m also pretty shy about carbs. I mean, I fucking love carbs. But the point is that regulating the insulin swings has helped a lot. And until probably a year ago I drank every night, without fail. Not to excess (usually), but in a kind of blowing off steam at the end of the day way. 2 - 3 glasses of wine, or a scotch or two. It’s taken me a year or so to ease out of that habit. Currently I just basically don’t drink at home. (Or rarely.) Just if we go out with friends, or something. God I drink a fuckton of fizzy water now. Oy vey. 

I’ve prayed my whole life, mostly. But I really really dug in when things were bleaker. As one does, I guess. But then I started to realize that what I was praying about was mostly circumstantial stuff. Which is valid, I’m sure, but I began to think that maybe that’s not God’s primary business. That conditions will sine-wave around all your life, but maybe what prayer is really about is something more wordless. I mean, the damn word machine upstairs just never shuts off, right? And since God knows good and well what you’re going through already, maybe it’s about stillness / presence / proximity / unclenching / something. Richard Rohr writes a lot about Centering Prayer as a practice, how it’s about resting in the mystery and stripping away your sort of binary interpretations of everything, growing more mature by “unknowing.” It makes some sense to me. I’m really shitty about actually doing it but it resonates with me.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> All of those things make a lot of sense to me. I have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to exercise. Like you, I’ve sensed that drinking at home is a mistake. There was a period a year or so ago when I started realizing that I drank almost every day and without pleasure. Before that it always seemed like booze made me feel some kind of relief. But then suddenly I realized I was pretty buzzed but not experiencing any relief at all. At that point drinking felt like an inconvenience more than anything. It’s been good to cut back. 

Something real weird happened here yesterday. I was with Roz at this bakery on the Southside. Things actually happen on Forest Hill these days. It’s hard to get used to. Anyway, we’re sitting there and Jason Cadell and his wife (girlfriend?) Katie walk in. Just seemed like a strange coincidence. They’re moving here. I hadn’t seen him since that time you, he, and I had breakfast in DC.

<b> Dec 17, 2018, at 1:58 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I know her pretty well-ish. I mean, I haven’t seen her in ages now but she was someone I saw around in DC a lot. Always seemed like a super solid person to me. Very sweet, always pursuing something creative and interesting. I don’t know details but if I remember correctly she had a really gnarly breakup with a guy who may have been abusive. This would have been years ago now but I think she mentioned it the last time I saw her, which was probably on a DC visit. She and I were never, like, super tight but she was part of my immediate social circle. In short: I like her a lot. Was she in RVA?

Also: so great that Jason and Katey are moving to Richmond. I wonder what prompted it. They own a house in DC. But that puts half the Dismemberment Plan in RVA. I miss those guys. And Eric Axelson. 

Also, upon reflection I realized I answered your earlier question with stuff that’s preventative, not necessarily useful in the midst of the darkness. And that I don’t really have a good answer for that except to say, “friends.’ I guess.

Talked to my mom, she’s pretty weak but she’s at home. I think she’s a lot more freaked out by her husband Herb’s situation than her own. Herb’s daughter is looking after them. My mom said she feels like she’ll be fine eventually but they don’t yet know the prognosis for Herb. She is not a person who willingly confronts mortality in any way. I mean, you and I aren’t morbid but we’ve had our brushes and I think we hold mortality sort of close, as a practice. She is a person who sweeps hard things under the rug. So this is hammering her.</br></br>

<b> Dec 18, 2018, at 6:00 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> “Friends” seems like a good answer. I think it’s interesting what skills people at our age have developed for coping when things are bleak. For example, I know to avoid eating chocolate when I feel my mouth breaking out in canker sores. There’s not always a lot of progress in coping…and it’s hard to come by, but I’ll take what I can get! But actual survival definitely boils down to friends.

I’m glad your mom and Herb have someone looking after them here. Man. I know all about people in your family not confronting mortality willingly. It leaves you alone with reality: Bluh. I am fortunate that Julie is more able to talk about it than she was a year ago, but for a while I was staring into the abyss (hers, that is) while it seemed like everyone else was, like, whistling and making circles in the dirt with the toes of their shoes. I have this standing argument with my friend Miriam’s husband Lance. He says he’s not afraid of death. I say he just hasn’t considered it sufficiently.

Interesting about Kendall Nordin. I kinda hope I end up getting to know her more. She lives here now, I don’t know why. "I’m basically over dating,” is what I tell myself. Yep. 

Hey, I just wrote a song about your wedding party. Please share with Alison if you like. Also, you have suggested “Iron Pants” and she has suggested “Soft Pants” as band names. What gives? Here’s the song:



<The Wedding Dance.m4a>


The Wedding Dance

While I was dancing
with the woman 
in the red blouse—
a silk blouse—
that shimmered
in the bloom
of light,

I asked her who
she thought the man
could be 
checking us out
from the 
other side
of the room.

“Who, him?
Well, he’s my husband,”
she said, “but don’t worry—
he just likes to watch.
He’s French.”

She tired of me quickly,
said straight up,
“You really don’t have any moves.”
She was right.
I never have had
any moves.</br></br>

<b> Dec 23, 2018, at 4:53 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> This is fantastic. “He’s French” — such a perfect punchline. Did you do this in Garage Band? I’m always amazed at how lived-in your recordings feel. Like, those horns are shockingly convincing. I dunno, maybe you got actual horn players? I just sent it to Alison. 

Look, if you don’t want our “pants” band names, maybe — MAYBE — if you’re nice to me you could use our standby fake band name… Night Goat. 

We have a whole sonic world built around Night Goat already, so you might need to kind up your greasy cock rock game if you’re gonna use it. You will need to throw the devil horns. You will need to shriek, “RIDIN’ THE MUTHAFUCKING NIIIIEEEEGHT GOAT!” (Imagine something between G ’N’ R and Mötley Crüe, though I don’t really see any makeup or teased hair involved.) There was actually a guy who worked at a restaurant here whom we christened “Night Goat” at one point, I forget why. Anyway, what I’m saying is: it’s a big responsibility, so think carefully on it.

The best part of it though is that we have no clear idea what any of it means.

I have this dilemma where I don’t know how much to call my mom. She calls me an average of 0.5 times per year, I call her probably 4.0 times maybe, in a good year. But I’ve called 3 times in the last week, and the last time she didn’t pick up so I left voice mail asking her to call me back. She has not, for three days now. I know that every time I talk to her it freaks her out. I tried to get my sister in on it but she hasn’t stepped up as much as hoped. Maybe I just bull through and keep calling, I dunno. No one really writes a primer for things like this.

I recommend getting a beverage with Kendall. She’s solid. She’s cool. I think she has a youngish kid (6-8 maybe?), but that shouldn’t be an issue. If nothing else, she’s good people. 

Someone opened an Austin-style breakfast taco place here and hot damn it’s good. 

Oh, btw, we should start kicking around dates for you to come visit. We have a couple of tricky weeks with work things that we’ll have to navigate, but that shouldn’t deter anyone. Even if we aren’t here for a few days we’ll have an empty house for use, or you can go explore the desert or Big Sur or whatever. In fact, I’m gonna make that a line in the budget, so start pondering.</br></br>

He had kids from other marriages and they're handling things, mostly. We're just going to go to the funeral and visit my mom. 

It's a weird moment, not least because it occurred to me I haven't been to my mom's house in maybe almost 20 years. I'm trying to remember if I've been there since I ran the Richmond Marathon, circa 2000. I don't think so. I don't actually remember quite how to get there.

I’ve been checking out Blue Nile’s Hats at your suggestion. I’m not surprised I’d missed it as I wouldn’t have liked it in its day. I’m still not sure I love it, but there are a lot of elements that are kinda stunning. Do you think the strings are real? Those arrangements are so great, especially on Saturday Night. 

I love all the crazy fruity density of the chord voicings. There’s also a cool harmonic vagueness about all of it. Not always clear in the midst of a song where the tonic is or if there is one. It’s sorta like smoothly minimalist or something. 

The guy is maybe almost too good a singer for me? He’s sounds like if Lou Gramm had taste. 

This thing sounds so weirdly timely. Future Islands, The Weekend, etc. I know nearly zero about current pop, but I’ve noticed that some of it sounds almost exactly like this.</br></br>

I only have one thing scheduled that I can’t miss, and that takes place the weekend of February 22-24. 

Apart from that the only known unknown is Julie’s health, which makes me think that sooner (like in the next couple of months, if that’s what you’re thinking?) is better. But it’s anyone’s guess.

</b> <br><br> This is the song:   

Singer / songwriter from NY named Nicole Mercedes. 

My good friend Rachel (from LA, is a script supervisor) directed. Rachel is Nicole’s aunt.

It’s not entirely clear why Nicole asked me to do it except maybe that she wanted a sad middle aged man who was willing and free.

Premise is a guy comes home from work, is seen getting into drag then sings his heart out to a disinterested crowd at a karaoke bar. He’s singing Nicole’s song.

I’d never been on a set before, and though it was (I’m told) a tiny crew (maybe 20 people?), it was educational for me to watch how all that stuff is done. I hope I didn’t fuck it up in the way that amateurs trying hard can fuck up this kind of thing. People I didn’t know said nice things, but I wondered if that’s just what people do.

People in the small film community here do each other these massive freebie favors for personal projects. They also seem to work insanely hard, as in fast and intensely. It was inspiring.

It’ll be a few months before either the album or the video are done. I guess Rachel will show me raw footage before then, but I vacillate between wanting to see it and never-ever wanting to.

It was enjoyable.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I’d like to stay for about a week. I’d like to see what your lives are like there. I imagine spending a lot / most of the daytime alone walking around, hanging out in coffeeshops, doing stuff you’ve done and don’t need to do again. I don’t need an exhaustive overview of Los Angeles. I’m more interested in the part of it you inhabit. Your neighborhood places and so on. I’m pretty happy to wander around alone during the day and hang during the nights for the most part if that suits you guys. I do want to see the Jurassic Technology museum. I would like to get to the ocean. Rachel says I should rent a bike and ride up the path to the Santa Monica pier and then observe life on that main boardwalk or whatever in Venice Beach as I’ve never been there. Basically I’d like to fart around and see the place as it relates to you. 

I never get to leave Richmond except to go to DC every other week for therapy, and that’s not a vacation, lemme tell ya. I’m so stoked that you guys have invited me to do this. 

Maybe we’ll go see a movie? Maybe I can find a really weird open mic to play at. I might try to connect with that dude I told you about meeting here who worked on Frank's Wild Years and Spike. I definitely intend to play with Angus to an absurd extent. I hope to meet some of your friends.</br></br>

ISSUE #32 / MARCH 2019
 
KAREN DALTON
You've written at length in song, poetry & prose about love. What is love? Why do love songs so frequently move us? Perhaps a list of your top 10 love songs?
MACK, BAIRNSDALE, AUSTRALIA 
How important is the song in your life, as a listener?
LUIZA, VIÇOSA, BRAZIL

Dear Mack and Luiza,

It’s the early hours of the morning, here in Los Angeles, and I can’t sleep. I’ve been in the studio all night, working on new songs. The melodies and words are running around in my head, so excuse this letter if it’s kind of scrambled. You asked about love, Mack, and maybe that’s what love is right there - maybe songs are the parlance of love. Maybe that’s what we have conceived them for – to give a voice to this strange, inscrutable feeling that tears away at us, all our lives. I don’t know. Maybe some songs are the embodiment of love itself and that’s why they move us so deeply. They are simple, plainspoken, incendiary devices that bomb the heart to pieces – something other art forms can’t do with the same sudden and frightening precision.

So, here is a list of ten of my most treasured love songs – old, sad songs mostly, and sentimental too, that have travelled with me through the years, holding sway over my world and never failing to rescue me. They are just small unassuming love bombs, but dear Luiza, as important as anything can ever be.

Much love, Nick
 

Ten Love Songs
 
To Love Somebody - Bee Gees

My Father - Nina Simone

I Threw It All Away - Bob Dylan

Comfort You - Van Morrison

Angel of the Morning - Merrilee Rush & The Turnabouts

Nights In White Satin - The Moody Blues

Where’s the Playground Susie? - Glen Campbell

Something On Your Mind - Karen Dalton

Always on My Mind - Elvis Presley

Superstar - Carpenters

People do not get me or like me. There’s a lot of slam poetry and whatnot. Also some great poets. While the equivalent musical scenario would be mortifying, these are somehow massively faith-inducing.</br></br>

<b>  March 30, 2019 at 1:28:28 PM PDT

</b> <br><br> Oh no, I left the wrong impression. They don’t fume. They’re indifferent mostly. Or slightly quizzical or something like that. Nobody is invested enough to fume. 

And part of what I love about this open mic is that most of the people there are not just unconcerned with the aesthetic quality of what they’re doing, they seem unaware that something as rarified as “aesthetic quality” could even come into the picture. It’s more like a 12-step meeting. People just stand up there and read something they wrote that afternoon about a breakup or whatever. One guy who seems to have autism writes these epic lists of trains he’s seen recently, and while it’s tedious as shit, it’s also just beautiful. Everyone claps and claps for that guy, and you can see that he’s pleased.

That’s not to say that nobody else is attempting to make art, just that the art people are a small minority. And even amongst them, there are zero of the academic poetry/snobby types.

It’s faith-inducing in terms of being reminded that as lousy as people usually are—myself and all these other folks included—some of us still think it seems like a good idea to stand in front of a group of strangers and tell stories about ourselves, what we’ve been through recently, what we’ve been thinking about, etc. It’s incredibly sad in a way. It’s in a shitty coffee shop. For some of us it’s our big chance at being the one on stage. The food is bad. But it renews the spirit somehow.

I read this last night, and after people applauded politely (one laughed a little), I got off the stage for the next person:

I remember playing a GRB show here among other musicians I was friends with and they were just befuddled. They had no idea what I was doing or why I would do it that way. They were so hellbent on delivering these perfectly anodyne folk-pop numbers. It was a real eye opener for me. Can't imagine what they thought of, like, "Kong Meets His Maker."

It really really amuses me to picture people just fuming at your reading.

It IS kind of beautiful, the small gathering with no stakes simply for joy. I think I always had a very conflicted time doing that. On the one hand, it's really the only kind of performance situation that matters. On the other, I'm always goaded by my self-aggrandizing ego to live up to the false premise established by The Rolling Stones and driven home by U2 that everything must be world-beating and massive and ageless. That shit is poison. But sometimes it gets results. I dunno.

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #34 / APRIL 2019
 
What does Elvis mean to you?
GEORGIA, GLASGOW, UK
Dear Georgia, 
In early 2000, I saw Johnny Cash walk into a studio in LA, old and ill and temporarily blind (he had toward the end of his life a condition that affected his sight), sit down and sing a song, then transform into a higher being. I have seen Nina Simone climb a flight of stairs to the stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London, barely able to walk, sit down at the piano and be transformed. I have seen Shane MacGowan stand on stage at a concert in France after taking ten LSD trips, and not knowing where he was, shuffle to the microphone, begin to sing so very beautifully, and be transformed. These transformative moments encapsulate the religious nature of performance as they imitate the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ Himself. This narrative of suffering and rebirth is played out again and again within our own lives, but I believe it is captured most beautifully, within the musical performance itself. Through the boundless power of music, a performer transcends his or her own wretchedness by performing a kind of public exorcism and by doing so, transforms into a deity. 
In 1981, in London, I saw the movie This Is Elvis. I had always been an Elvis fan, with a special love for the songs he made in the seventies – Suspicious Minds, In the Ghetto, Kentucky Rain, Always on My Mind – and had a particular obsession with the gospel album, How Great Thou Art that he recorded in the early sixties. The last ten minutes of This Is Elvis changed my ideas on performance forever. 
In the final minutes of the film, we see Elvis, on stage in Las Vegas, sing the famous so-called ‘Laughing Version’ of Are You Lonesome Tonight? The camera begins with a long shot and does a slow zoom in on Elvis’s face. Elvis is stoned and overweight and by the time he performs the disastrous central monologue, we can see the pure anguish of his performance, the drugged and mortified eyes, the terrible aloneness, the horror of the moment - his vast soul crucified on the cross of his own body as he blunders through the words. It is one of the most traumatic pieces of footage I have ever seen. This is followed by the medley, An American Trilogy. Elvis dies and as the world media reports his death, we hear him sing Dixie over shots of his funeral procession. We see the motorcade, the weeping crowds, the coffin, and the flowers, as the film returns to the Vegas concert and Elvis sings the eternally beautiful All My Trials. To me it is immeasurably moving, Elvis’s head bowed, his extraordinary voice steeped in sorrow - then the band rises, he lifts his head and sings The Battle Hymn of the Republic and Elvis is resurrected, triumphant. It is pure religion and as powerful as anything I have ever seen. The final shot of him, in slow motion, arms outstretched, the angel wings of his silver cape flung wide, shows his exultant ascent into heaven. 
As I walked from the cinema, I was left with these three images - Elvis’s mortified, tear-streaked face; his head hung in sorrowful acceptance; and his caped arms outstretched in triumph. These are the stages of Christ’s passage upon the cross, the anguish, the sufferance and the resurrection, a journey which welcomes us all, in time. 
Elvis continued performing until the end. In my eyes, he was some kind of angel; both terribly and awfully human yet divine in his meteoric reach that touched so many hearts. He was fallible and God-like at the same time. He crucified himself on stage in Vegas, at the supper show and the late show, hundreds and hundreds of times. His latter years on Earth were as sad and lonely as any can be, but his Vegas performances were epic triumphs of human transcendence, where the angels looked down on one who had fallen so far, then looked up to where he ascended. 
Much love, Nick

<b> Apr 5, 2019, at 8:08 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So we're a go for a taping of Big Bang Theory. I've never seen the show, I have no idea who any of the characters are, but it should be super interesting weird Hollywood fun. Obviously, Alison's boss is the star. He's super nice. Multi-cam shows are kind of like live theater, except with the writers down front making tweaks. I think they run the show twice? But I'm not sure. I'm curious about it all. Also, the show is ending after this season so there's a lot of emotion / sentiment floating around. (Not from Jim, he's ready to be done.)

</b> <br><br> This is awesome. Not the kind of thing I’d have envisioned experiencing in life.</br></br>

<b> Apr 8, 2019, at 12:46 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Here are some very basic thoughts about stuff to do in L.A. Of course, if you look online you’ll find your own ideas.

LOS ANGELES VISIT
Cool stuff to do

West Side / Culver City
Museum of Jurassic Technology. In Culver City, near Sony studio lot. We want to go to this too.
Venice. You’ve seen the beach in a million TV shows. There’s also Abbott-Kinney, which is a long strip of boutiques,  galleries, restaurants, etc. Good for celeb sighting.
Santa Monica. The beach in S.M. and Venice is worth a walk. There’s also the S.M. Pier, with a big Ferris Wheel and stuff.
Malibu. Pacific Coast Highway / Hwy 1. Driving this is basically mandatory. Stunning beyond words. There are interesting things along the way—Hearst Castle, sea lion breeding grounds, the Madonna Inn (weird baroque motel), Big Sur.

Mid-City
LACMA is a good museum. Peterson Auto Museum has all manner of cars.

Hollywood / Los Feliz / Silver Lake / Echo Park
Hollywood is grimy, flat, weird, and generally sucks. Los Feliz is where the East Side starts and it’s got some charm. Silver Lake is hipster heaven, but genuinely pretty and fun to drive around. There’s a great reservoir for walking around. The hills hide all kinds of crazy interesting homes. Sunset Blvd is the main thoroughfare, but it’s crossed by Silver Lake Blvd which has some stuff too. Echo Park is the slightly less-gentrified version of Silver Lake. It has an even more lovely reservoir for walking and such. Both have lots of cool shops and restaurants and whatever.
Specifics:
Griffith Observatory. Also the park is great for strolling, hikes, trek up behind the Hollywood sign, great coffee and snacks at Trails Café. (We take Angus there a lot.)
Drive along Mulholland Drive. Twisty, beautiful, good views, crazy rich homes, David Lynch.
Dresden Room bar features Marty & Elaine, the kitschy crooners from SWINGERS. Also a bar a few doors down does a weekly jazz night with Jeff Goldblum.
Arclight Cinema. Best place to see movies. It’s also next to Amoeba Records, which is a huge vinyl record store. 
Dodger Stadium, if you want a cheap ticket to see a) baseball, and b) fistfights.
Studio tours. We’ll be going to Warner Bros for the taping. But if you want more, Paramount is good. Universal is mostly a theme park. 
There might be good outdoor music shows at the Hollywood Bowl or the Greek Theater.

Downtown-ish
Arts District. Hauser & Wirth gallery, located in the Arts District, is free and has a great little bar / bistro. The Arts District is also good for walking around, checking out stuff, eating and drinking. 
Other art museums and such -- MOMA. Disney Hall  (L.A. Phil, iconic architecture) / Redcat (for avant performances). The Broad.
Little Tokyo. It’s next to the Arts District, tons of amazing sushi and such. Also you can take the Metro from our house to get to both neighborhoods.
Downtown. The Bradbury Building is where BLADE RUNNER was filmed. It’s near Grand Central Market, which is a zillion food stalls under one open-air structure. 
Ace Hotel rooftop has a great bar with views. 
Olvera Street is the oldest street in L.A. and set up to walk through. It’s across from the gorgeous Union Station. 
There’s a lot of good food, bars, etc. There’s also districts – like the Fashion District, the Flower District, etc. Also it’s all bordered by Skid Row, which is an eye opener. L.A. has a massive homeless population and it’s a problem no one has addressed very effectively.

Highland Park / Nearby
We can give you the full lowdown. But in our neighborhood, we’re situated between the two main drags – York Blvd. and Figueroa Street. You can walk to both. Each has its particular charms. 

Out of town
There are a bunch of cool places to visit within a couple hours’ drive.
Joshua Tree / Palm Springs. Our go-to. We love the desert to a surprising degree. Both are about 2 hours away, though very different in flavor. Palm Springs is lots of mid-century modern homes, spas, shopping, restaurants. We go occasionally. But mostly we hit JT. It’s small, dusty, quiet, austere. Enough “cool” stuff to meet our needs but generally pretty scruffy. The park is insane—like Mars meets the Flintstones. Eerie, otherworldly, a must-see. The town has a bunch of gems. There’s a main strip with a few bars / restaurants. Then there’s weird desert art, like the Noah Purefoy outdoor exhibit. There’s fun hippie stuff like the Integratron for “sound baths,” whatever that is (never been, it’s always booked). We like this saloon called Pappy & Harriet’s, in this town that started as a film set for Westerns called Pioneertown. They have legit great music (indie, roots, bigger artists than you’d think). Not too far from it is this incredible French-hybrid restaurant out in the actual middle of nowhere, called La Copine. It’s only open weird hours, 2-5pm or something, but the food is unbelievable. 

The Salton Sea / Salvation Mountain. This is only if you’re going out to JT / Palm Springs, but it’s a mind-bender. Google them.

San Diego / Tijuana / Rosarito. SD is a very different flavor than L.A. Tijuana is said to have come up a lot in recent years, with a big food scene now. Rosarito is a beach town about 30 mins beyond the border. Pretty sure you can cross the border with just a drivers license, but check.

Death Valley. Never been but hear it’s insane. 

Las Vegas. Fuck that place. But maybe you need to get married quick. About a 4hr drive.

Angeles National Forest / Mt. Wilson Observatory. You can see these from our house. It’s just a pleasant scenic drive. Great overlooks of the city. The snack bar at Mt. Wilson is said to have great pie. You drive up Hwy 2. It winds around a lot. There’s also a decent bar where bikers congregate (the fancy kind, not the methy kind) which makes a good destination about an hour in.</br></br>

I decided to spend more time with Scott Walker mostly based on your interest in him. Sometimes it’s hard for me to hear a thing without hearing everything that flowed from it, so that by the time I get to it, the original thing sounds stale. Coming to him naively, he sounded like Tom Jones at first. But this shit is pretty fucked up. The orchestrations are phenomenal. Which, like, duh. Anyways, I figure if I can soften on Rush after one rock doc, I might as well give this dude a go.

That is all.

<b> Jun 10, 2019, at 12:17 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Someone was like: “This isn’t quite right. Something’s missing. I know, it should open with 20 seconds of amp tremolo noise.” 

Crazy thing: they were right. I love that at this point they were playing, like, Montreux Jazz and stuff. Actively confusing aficionados of multiple genres. That’s greatness.

Everything sounds so sick on that record. Man. Have you read the Phill Brown account of the recording process he went through with them? It’s something.

Things is pretty okay. Had to do a little hospital over Memorial Day for a weird bacterial infection in my face. I felt fine but there was a real Whitman’s Sampler of antibiotics, none of which were working, so then some minor surgery to drain and clean. First hospitalization ever. Felt like the world’s shittiest hotel. Nice view of Burbank and planes taking off, though.

Alison is doing well. Getting round. We spent the weekend rearranging the house to make room for baby stuff. “Baby gack,” as we call it. This  morning I read an excerpt from David Lynch’s memoir https://thequietus.com/articles/26601-room-to-dream-david-lynch-eraserhead-jack-nance which somehow makes him seem both more normal and weirder. Angus got a bath yesterday. He’s like a cotton ball now. I’m going to New York this weekend for a Creative Capital weekend. Maybe help some artist types work a Hollywood side hustle. I had a ticket to see Glenda Jackson play King Lear but she canceled the last couple weeks of shows. I’m super bummed. I will, however, go see Sleep No More again and catch up with my friend Richard Vernon.

How’s things there? Seems like the music shiz is coming together.</br></br>

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> Man. Your infection is upsetting. How are you doing now? 

I have not read the Phil Brown account. I don’t know who that is, but I’ll find the article and read it. You know, everything may be perfect about those records—and I’d not given the solo record its due—but they’re not things I want to listen to a whole lot. For me one of the weird things about music that traffics in that kind of subtlety is that it feels pretty somber. I love it, but a little can go a long way. Like a great poem. It’s how I feel about Arvo Part, certain Keith Jarrett, and a lot of Radiohead. Not really music you listen to while scrubbing the bathroom or getting ready for friends coming over. 

I’m glad to hear that Alison’s doing well. “Getting round” is a funny phrase. What’s the latest name leader?

Music stuff: It is going well. Lots of fun. We’re recording a couple of songs at a leisurely pace. I’m taking a short series of voice lessons, and after two of them I’m amazed at what I’ve learned. 

Julie seems to be declining. That’s been the case for a while, but now there are objective measures (oxygen saturation and whatnot) indicating that the decline is speeding up. It’s basically so strange and difficult to cope with that I don’t think I am coping with it.

Please let me know how your face is doing. I find that tale frightening.</br></br>

My father was in town and circled a spot on her leg with a sharpie and said, "If there's any pink outside this line in a few hours, go to the ER." We went to the ER a few hours later. The doctor entered the room and stopped cold 8' from Chesley. She said, "Don't you want to examine my leg?" The doctor said, "I just did," and left the room. IV antibiotics, abscess, surgery, Man, I'm really glad you're okay. That shit's nasty.

Thanks for the Talk Talk link. I look forward to reading that. I enjoyed the David Lynch one you sent.

There's nothing wise to say about Julie. It's awful, and that's that.

Voice lessons. I thought I had pitch problems, but it turns out my pitch is very accurate. The problem is that I don't know how to breathe. During last week's lesson — the lessons are more like yoga than anything — everything lined up for a second and I produced this insane, loud bass note. My teacher's eyebrows raised. I said, "What the hell was that?" She said, "That's your voice."

How’s shizz there?

Shizz here is the same as before and probably similar to the shizz that’s upcoming. Just say “Book Smart” at the Byrd and laughed a lot.</br></br>

<b> Jul 6, 2019, at 11:29 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Shizz is okay here. We're in Joshua Tree at the moment. Have to get out of town for the Fourth. Angus can't abide the fireworks. We had a couple earthquakes, so everyone is buzzing about that. It was more interesting than scary -- the place sways but nothing fell off the walls. It wouldn't take a lot more, though, for it to be gnarly. 

This eve we went to one of our favorite spots, this roadhouse called Pappy & Harriet's, where they have actual good bands but mostly it's about people hanging around drinking in this tiny weird fake Western town that was built for the movies 70 years ago. Crazy mix of people. From bikers to hipsters to European tourists. Tonight this woman Cate Le Bon is playing. I've seen her name on music blogs but never listened to her. I like to imagine that she's the daughter of Simon Le Bon. She probably isn't.

The desert is so quiet that it's disconcerting. There's a small telescope here so we're gonna look at some stars and shit later.

<b> Jul 7, 2019, at 7:12 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I heard about the earthquakes and wondered how it was going with the ham radios? Man I don’t want to hear news of a bad one.

Pappy & Harriet’s sounds awesome. Doesn’t it seem like Cate Le Bon has to be related to Simon Le Bon? How many Le Bons can there be? Does Le Bon mean “The Good?”

Listen, here’s something puzzling. Two of the people in my band are genuinely into Marillion. I mean into it like aficionados. I’d never heard of Marillion. And now, having heard Marillion, I’m pretty sure I was better off before. But these guys are smart people with thoughtful taste. Have you known people like this? I mean, Ben is equally comfortable discussing the merits of Toto (obviously he’s wrong because there aren’t any) and Einstürzende Neubauten or, I don’t know, The Melvins. He’s either free of irony or the irony is so deep that I don’t get it. We’ve been having some interesting talks about how we find pleasure (or don’t) in the music we encounter. I admire his extreme catholicity of taste, though I can’t escape the idea that he’s a genuine misanthrope and is just fucking with me. 

Anyway, I’m listening to the 2017 remaster (WHY IN GOD’S NAME, WHY?!) of Marillion’s “Misplaced Childhood” because I said I would. I DARE YOU TO TRY IT! I double dog dare you.</br></br>

https://youtu.be/-qFbQbVhtEs

This guy who played in my friend Jeff’s band (The Terraplanes) in college once said, in earnest, “You kinda have to like everything.” He was making a serious argument that it’s all human music and expresses something. I get it, in concept anyway, but I can’t say I’ve successfully adopted that. I think I’m a lot more open / less threatened than I used to be by stuff that doesn’t come from my tribe, or whatever. But shit, man, some stuff is bad. Then again, I’m talking to a guy who’s gone over to the Rush camp, so maybe I’m just wrong. I dunno. 

I think I’ll need a little more incentive than just a double dog dare to listen to a whole Marillion album. What are you offering?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I’ve been thinking about your refusal to take my dare. I guess it indicates that you are an adult. I’d say you don’t know what you’re missing by not listening to that record, but I bet there’s a high correspondence between what you imagine Marillion is all about and what they actually are all about. 

I remember that you once described yourself as more of a supporter of Elvis Costello than a fan. That’s slightly related how I feel about Rush now. I do think it’s horrible music, but I’m glad they existed in all their nerdy glory. And I perversely enjoy it when I hear it on the radio.</br></br>

ISSUE #50 / JULY 2019
 
Do you pray with you'r family and maybe friends,hopeing that sometimes 'someone' leesen you'rdespered 'litle' iner-voice, to get answeror gidence, ephifany, in this cruel world,which most of us taket for granted? 
GIANELLI, PULA, CROATIA
Dear Gianelli,
I love this despairing and soulful question so much. I have put it in verse form and changed the spacing so that it behaves as a poem, rather than a question, as it rises hauntingly from the dark. I hope you don’t mind. I will do my best to answer it.
Firstly, do I pray with my family and friends? The answer is sadly no. My family, and especially my friends, are mostly not the praying types, and I’m not sure they would know who to pray to if they were  – apart that is from darling Susie, my wife. Susie prays a lot, I think, but alone, I would say, terribly alone. I do pray myself – and I also meditate; prayer and meditation are different practices but they serve a similar function. 
Do I hope someone listens to my prayers – to my inner voice? Well, I don’t know where my prayers go. I don’t know if anyone is listening. However, I still kneel down alone and pray. My prayers mostly revolve around the wellbeing of the ones I love, because I feel, possibly erroneously, that the world aligns itself in such a way that it draws those I send my prayers to closer to me. I feel, without any evidence to suggest that this is true, that the people I pray for benefit from my prayers, as if the energy of my prayers travels along streams of collective goodness that connect us all in some way, in a sort of humanistic cooperation of light and compassion.
Do I get guidance from prayer and meditation? The answer is certainly, yes. After applying my full attention to whatever it is I am praying about – and to whoever it is I am praying to – I feel that I simply know how to proceed in a rightful way; one that causes the least harm to myself and to others. I feel less a victim of the endless self-defeating thoughts that can go on in my mind, and instead I feel a quietness and clarity of thought.
Is this world cruel? I don’t think so. I think this world is indifferent and indifference is not cruelty. What connects me to you, Gianelli, and you to every other sentient being in the universe, is that the universe, simply does not care about us; it does not act with malice or desire to harm us – it is simply unaffected by our condition. If one acknowledges this state of affairs, then it sets up a situation that allows us to make a simple choice – either we respond to the indifference of the universe with self-pity and narcissism – as if the world has in some way personally betrayed us – and live our lives in a cynical, pessimistic and self-serving manner; or we stand tall, set our eyes clearly upon this unfeeling universe and love it all the same – even though, or especially because, it doesn’t love us. This act of cosmic defiance, of subversive optimism, of unconditional and insubordinate love, is the greatest act of human beauty we can perform. To stand before this great, blank, heartless cosmic event and say: ‘We believe in you’. ‘We love you’. ‘We care for you’. This is the definition of grace, Gianelli, and this is the epiphany you speak of. We create our own divinity, our own Godliness, through our ferocious need. We yearn the heavens awake, and if we are quiet, in prayer or in meditation, sometimes we can feel the heavens stirring, breathing our fragile and reckless love back through us.  
Thank you for your question.
Love, Nick

<b> Aug 13, 2019, at 3:00 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> That’s a great ending to Purple Iris.

This is gonna sound weird, but I’m always sort of surprised when someone sends me something to hear and it’s, like, super well thought out and accomplished in its execution. I must have been ruined by all the mediocre punk bands I befriended. It’s insane how sick all the playing is. It's never showy. Never too much. No one competes with each other. It’s just exactly what is needed and no more. There’s a lot of air in it — which is the true mark of mastery. Yet there’s great little moments of, “Whoa, what the fuck did s/he do right there?” I love that. 

I’m also a big fan of a “soft” song with some eye-popping lyrical thing. (As you know.) Man that’s great shit on Weird Animal. I was listening to both songs, struck by your singing and how it seems so much more confident, or something, than I remember from the older recordings by The ‘Mans. It reminds me of how at some point Elvis Costello sort, out of nowhere, had these amazing pipes, and you’re just like: Where did that come from? 

Also good job whoever recorded it. Sounds expensive.</br></br>

Him and the ‘Mans

I’m having trouble coming up with a nickname for your band. I’m going with The ‘Mans. You’re just going to have to live with it.

You know of this band Battles? I’ve known a guy in that band for like 25 years now. We first met through mutual band friends because he asked if we’d throw a show for his band at my Oregon Hill house. He offered to provide a keg. His band was from Pittsburgh. He was in Don Caballero back then but I think it was his side band, Storm and Stress, that played at my house. I took him up on it and he ribbed me about the keg for years. I dunno, I felt like a deal was a deal. Anyway, Battles has put out four records on Warp now and Tyondai Braxton used to be in the band and they’re actually a lot more enjoyable than I would have predicted. But it’s so interesting to me how a) musicians’ tastes evolve, and b) that Ian Williams has somehow managed to be in a cool band for almost three decades now. I’ve always wondered how he supports himself. He used to write financial journalism but I don’t know what he does in between albums and tours. His drummer is the guy from Helmet, which really should be a bad sign, but it’s totally fine. They’re playing a club down the street from here in December. I may walk down there and see them. Their tours now consist of festivals all around the world and major cities. You can tell from the itinerary that they fly between shows. I don’t think they’re rich but that’s absolutely the way to go if you can.

I always liked this video. You get me with slapstick every time. https://youtu.be/vWbhpqxLHVE Ian’s the guy playing keys. 

Alison is very round. She genuinely looks like she swallowed a soccer ball. I’ll try to get a photo.

Her mom and aunt are here for the baby shower. No dudes allowed at that, thank God.

I don’t want to make you talk about it you don’t want to, but I have to ask how you’re doing.

I also have to ask where you’re playing the show.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> That Battles video is nuts. I think you might’ve sent that to me before. It’s both funny and ominous! 

Speaking of flying to gigs, I heard Willie Nelson tell a funny story about that on Fresh Air. He was playing bass in Ray Price’s band when his first royalty checks from “Crazy” started showing up. Price and his band travelled on a bus and stayed in Holiday Inns. Willie started flying first class and renting penthouses at The Ritz and whatnot. When they got home he’d be as broke as everyone else.

Please do get a photo of Alison looking like she’s swallowed a soccer ball. A while back I was at a restaurant overlooking the museum’s sculpture garden. I saw a couple having a pregnancy photo shoot down there. Looked like the kinds of pictures that get superimposed over a brandy glass. This seems like a good idea for the Masseys.

Name contenders at this late date?

How I am: I’m basically okay as far as Julie stuff goes. We all had a long time to grieve even while she was alive, and I guess that makes a difference? I suspect there will continue to be moments when I have pangs of missing her. Writing and sharing that eulogy was extremely helpful as far as like…summarizing something essential about our connection. Also it helped me access my tears, which is not easy. Hunter seems very up and then very down which is saying something as he is probably the most stable human being I’ve ever known. The kids mostly seem relieved. I’m not entirely sure that Natalie is engaging with her emotions about it. Jacob has more skill at examining his feelings. He says he mostly feels stunned. 

The show will be at Gallery 5. It’s in Jackson Ward. It was the Firehouse Museum when you lived here. Below is a flier from the last time we played there — it was with Scott Crowder and my friend Liza.

Keep me posted on developments.</br></br>

<b> Sep 7, 2019, at 7:30 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Heya. Things are pretty good. Getting close to The Event. Alison is feeling ready to start getting her body back. We've taken all the classes, read the books (well, I still have to read some), got all the baby gear. I feel about as ready as I probably can be. I know there's no preparing for it, really. 

I'm actually away for the weekend with some guys, up at a rented lake house. We're at Lake Arrowhead, which is an alpine lake atop a mountain about 60 miles (but two hours drive) away from our house. It's pretty nice. I've been swimming and reading a '60s potboiler called "Gambit" that I found on the shelf here. 

We're in pretty good spirits. I know there's an emotional tsunami headed my direction but right now things are pretty even keel. We'll see what happens. Just because of the physical stress, she's about ready to be done with work. She's cancelling most meetings and working from home a lot. She'll go on leave probably the week after my birthday, so like the 16th. I've had a weird year, work-wise, and I haven't made a single dollar this year. But I'm about to sign a pilot deal that will deliver a modest chunk of change. But there are several other projects underway and I'm anticipating having to be a new parent and also work nonstop. Not sure how that's gonna go.

Sorry, I cant remember, did you have the Humans show? How did it go?

This was the first time I’d performed in front of an audience where I sought and then made a real connection through the heart.

<b> Oct 11, 2019, at 4:49 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Man, I got obsessed with it. The whole thing haunts me. Seriously. It weirds me out that someone I knew, even tangentially, could be so far gone. Last I heard her union got her fired and booted. The LAPD was investigating but I don’t know what came of that.

Did you see the security cam vids their neighbors took? One shows Andrew trying to control Heather and wrangle her inside. Another shows him sitting on the curb, head in hands, as she rants and walks in the street. I don’t care what she said on Instagram, she wasn’t drunk. She’s off her meds. She clearly has serious mental health issues that she’s not controlling with medication. 

That in no way excuses what’s clearly actual racist beliefs. But it complicates the picture a little. As you can imagine, the NextDoor app for our vicinity went apeshit over this and someone posted allegedly hacked Instagram DMs in which some white supremacist in Seattle is trying to be supportive of her after her firing. She mentions that she’s protected by a small local Klan group. THAT was the eye-popper for me. So there is a KKK group somewhere in my area. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised but I am. God that’s gross. 

I was never tight with either her or Andrew. But she was tight with my housemate Heather. And I was friendly with Andrew. I remember back in the day that Scott Burger had been over at Andrew’s place and commented on the unusual amount of WW2 Nazi memorabilia. And Sliang Laos always had that vaguely fascistic vibe about them. But I never gave it much credence. i thought it was punk rock shock aesthetics, you know? I guess not. 

I’ve only seen Andrew a couple times around here. Chatted with him once. Nice enough guy. Fucking virulent racist, apparently, as well. So creepy. I literally had bad dreams about the two of them this last week. 

Man, I’m gonna google that to see what else has developed.</br></br>

<b>  October 13, 2019 at 5:53:29 PM PDT
 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> I read a lot about it, too. It’s upsetting. It’s so easy to believe that this shit doesn’t exist in circles we overlap with. People in the arts...educated, etc. I have not seen the neighbors’ footage. The most interesting stuff for me was african americans in LA processing it on Twitter. There was a lot of fierce wisdom there. 

When I lived in DC and worked at the American Corporate Counsel Association, one of its leaders had Tourette’s. In all kinds of company he would say the most vile racist things. Everybody knew what his deal was, and nobody seem to take offense. If anything they seemed to have pity on him when he had an outburst. He was good at communicating about his condition, and his claim that he did not harbor racist beliefs seemed credible. In a world of slick corporate attorneys his total lack of control coupled with a sweet humility leant him a winning vulnerability. 

I didn’t get that feeling from the video. I’ve said and done things—mostly to myself—while psychotic that I wouldn’t do while sane. I think it’s plausible that she was having a manic episode or was high on something. But given all the context, the simpler explanation seems to be that she’s just a straight up white supremacist. It could also be that she’s a virulent racist who’d gone off her meds. 

There’s a bizarre and sad kind of vindication in all of this for me. I’m ashamed to admit it almost, but the truth is that back in the 90s I felt something genuinely evil coming off of Sliang Laos that I didn’t feel from other artists dealing with similarly transgressive material. They reminded me of my father’s sadism. I was viscerally scared by them. My father appreciated the Nazis’ ruthlessness, their dispassionate cruelty. Sliang Laos scared the shit out of me on some similar primitive level. But then I found a lot of the generally punk ethos threatening, so it could be that I was just kind of a wuss. 

In any case, that detail about Scott Burger’s visit to Andrew Sigler’s house is just totally chilling. What the fuck? Is there more of this around than we know? I just had dinner with my good friend Liza and her husband David, who I like a lot, but who is extremely interested in WWII German military stuff. This CVS episode makes me paranoid that there’s more of this shit hiding in plain sight.</br></br>

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #66 / OCTOBER 2019

PAINTING BY PETER BOOTH
Why do you write?
WILL, NASHVILLE, USA 
What are your political leanings, in a broad way?
SNORRI, REYKJAVIK, ICELAND 
How 'woke' are you?
STELLA, PORTLAND, USA
Dear Will, Snorri and Stella,One of the reasons I write is because it allows me the freedom to move beyond the declared world into the uncanny and unfamiliar world. As a songwriter I have made a commitment to uncertainty and to embrace that which I do not know, because I feel this is where true meaning exists. It allows me to write songs that have within them the spirit of enquiry and reciprocity. It leaves me open to chance, a sense of open-ended potentiality, and fills me with a devotion to the mystery of the world with its deep oceans and dark forests. This notion of uncertainty, of doubt, contains an enormous amount of creative power and is always accompanied by a state of yearning for something beyond certitude, beyond comprehension. My songs are essentially religious songs in that they hold within them a condition of longing for some approximation of Godliness.But organised religion itself poses a huge problem for me. Even though it would be so much easier to doze off in the arms of a mutually decided truth, I find that, in most cases, structured systems of faith are specifically designed to switch off the apparatus of inquiry by presenting themselves as the ‘one true religion’. As a consequence, I am left feeling bored and cornered by the hubris of their own sureness.I have always found great motivating energy in the idea that the thing I live my life yearning for, let’s call it God, in all probability does not exist. I feel my songs are conversations with the divine that might, in the end, be simply the babblings of a madman talking to himself. It is this thrilling uncertainty, this absurdity, from which all of my songs flow, and more than that, it is the way I live my life.So, for me, Stella, living in a state of enquiry, neutrality and uncertainty, beyond dogma and grand conviction, is good for the business of songwriting, and for my life in general. This is the reason I tend to become uncomfortable around all ideologies that brand themselves as ‘the truth’ or ‘the way’. This not only includes most religions, but also atheism, radical bi-partisan politics or any system of thought, including ‘woke’ culture, that finds its energy in self-righteous belief and the suppression of contrary systems of thought. Regardless of the virtuous intentions of many woke issues, it is its lack of humility and the paternalistic and doctrinal sureness of its claims that repel me.Antifa and the Far Right, for example, with their routine street fights, role-playing and dress-ups are participants in a weirdly erotic, violent and mutually self-sustaining marriage, propped up entirely by the blind, inflexible convictions of each other’s belief systems. It is good for nothing, except inflaming their own self-righteousness. The New Atheists and their devout opponents are engaged in the same dynamic. Wokeness, for all its virtues, is an ideology immune to the slightest suggestion that in a generation’s time their implacable beliefs will appear as outmoded and fallacious as those of their own former generation. This may well be the engine of progress, but history has a habit of embarrassing our treasured beliefs. Some of us, for example, are of the generation that believed that free speech was a clear-cut and uncontested virtue, yet within a generation this concept is seen by many as a dog-whistle to the Far Right, and is rapidly being consigned to the Left’s ever-expanding ideological junk pile. This is not to suggest we should not have our convictions or, indeed, that we should not be angry with the state of the world, or that we should not fight in order to correct the injustices committed against it. Conviction and anger can be the most powerful expressions of universal love. However, my duty as a songwriter is not to try to save the world, but rather to save the soul of the world. This requires me to live my life on the other side of truth, beyond conviction and within uncertainty, where things make less sense, absurdity is a virtue and art rages and burns; where dogma is anathema, discourse is essential, doubt is an energy, magical thinking is not a crime and where possibility and potentiality rule. The answers to the secrets of the heart may just be there, in the inscrutable dark of the forest, in the unfathomable depths of the sea, at the uncertain tips of our fingers.Love, Nick

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Maybe we talked about liberal virtue signaling a while back? That’s one of the orthodoxies that’s scaring me now. 

When people I basically like appear to be competing in the identity politics olympics I’m as puzzled as I am by religious people who make that weird lip clucking sound every time before they address God in a prayer circle. 

I love how NC tied all that together. He’s a hero of skepticism AND faith. 

BTW, my Skinny Amber poem got me in some hot water with some earnest 20-somethings I care about. Part of their criticism (which I heard second hand) was fair—they thought I should’ve changed Amber’s name. I disagree, but I take the point and acknowledge that I may be wrong. Their main beef was that it made them uncomfortable about a story involving sexuality, and they thought that was over the line. They appear to believe that if they feel uncomfortable then they’ve been mistreated. I don’t see where that kind of doctrine redounds to anyone’s benefit, including the vulnerable people they’d like to protect from harm.</br></br>

<b> Oct 22, 2019, at 3:03 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Dry signal is rough, man. It takes a certain kind of delivery for that to sound good. You ever listen to that Ryan Adams record, "Heartbreaker?" Really dry vocals. Sounds great. I think it takes a very even voice, good pitch, not a lot of fireworks. Or something. I dunno. Never could swing it, myself. Only for effect, in certain spots.

I used to have kind of a weird resistance to reverb / echo in the late 90s for some reason that I now forget. It's a bummer, because I listen to some of that Telegraph Melts stuff and just smack my forehead. It would sound SO MUCH better with some wetness on it. I am weird.

Here’s a haiku:

Voila, Sonic Youth. 

Did the Getty fire affect you guys at all? 

I had such a good time in Los Angeles. 

We have a show next week, and I’m excited about my outfit. 

That’s all I got for the time being. 

What’s news?</br></br>

<b> Nov 8, 2019, at 1:10 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> We also started Letterkenny over. Last night we watched the one I think from S3 or something where a matchmaker sends Wayne on three dates. Man that's good stuff. It has the all time classic opener where they're chucking the ball and Squirrelly Dan talks about his lady bringing attention to his "buttsholes." And the guys are so uncomfortable that they silently cut him out of the ball chucking. God I laughed.

Also, we're going to see the live show when it comes here. Maybe you should come too.

A haiku:

People like Pavement,
I like the band called Boston.
Hitler loved his dog.

We had the weirdest moment with the Getty Fire -- which was way across town from us and left us completely unaffected. My mom called, which she never does, and left a panicked message saying, "You're getting out of town, right?" I texted her to say the fire was nowhere near us. Like, if Shockoe Bottom were on fire I wouldn't advise her to evacuate her house in Short Pump. Then she called Alison's mom and hysterically tried to get her to convince us to leave. I'm genuinely not sure what to make of it. Also -- not directly related but a kind of counterpoint -- she reluctantly scheduled a visit to see the baby in January.

We would love it if you came back to L.A. It's been a weird year, obviously, but I think I'm getting paid in a couple weeks, so there would be dough available. But, hell, I'd also contribute to a Tim Vacay to somewhere else. I'm a big advocate of vacays. 

News: six weeks in we've reached a turning point -- the baby didn't exactly sleep through the night but we cluster-fed him before bed (11pm) and then stalwartly refused to get up and feed him at 2am, though he squawked like crazy, because the theory is the cluster-feed provides enough calories to get through the night, and eventually he went back to sleep. So we got the approximation of six unbroken hours of sleep. FUCK YES.

He's in a phase where it's pretty doable to get out of the house after a feed because he sleeps pretty well. Happy Hour is our new jam. It's funny too because now we notice other parents with babies at the same places we go. #1 place we go, by the way, is this spot that has a coffee shop, pizza by the slice (with beer and cheep rose), a wine store, and Italian food. It has a sort of courtyard where you can bring a dog and roll a stroller. Lots of seating. We go around 5pm or so and it's tons of other frazzled-looking parents with strollers drinking wine.

I love the idea of a place that serves coffee, pizza by the slice, wine by the glass, etc. to parents with young kids. It’s like a much better version of a mall food court. I loved that Black Flag onesie. Did Henry Rollins respond?

Your mother remains a puzzle to me. 

I’d love to come back to LA someday. I’d like to live in an oceanfront apartment in Santa Monica. Maybe I’ll add that to my “manifestation practice.” Kidding.

What’s up with your Billie Holliday project these days?

After our first show I had a (probably predictable) mental health crisis that despite being fairly awful has been productive overall. Was pretty unstable for several ways, but remained a bit more grounded in the midst of it than I have in the past. Feeling better now. It shifts around a lot. Something about this band is making me feel more alive…possibly than ever, and there’s a menace inside who resents that. Anyway, the show we played last Thursday was in a bar…as opposed to the first one that was a seated thing with readers beforehand. We were twice as old as the people in the other bands. We played first. I was dubious that the narrative component would play in front of a lot of 20-somethings. But it connected in such a beautiful and genuinely humbling way. There’s some kind of different thing happening, something I’ve never felt before. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it feels holy, and I am grateful. Here’s the best pic from the other night:</br></br>

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #72 / NOVEMBER 2019
 
BLIXA BARGELD SCREECHING
Is the screeching at the end of 'Stagger Lee' due to the fact that when Stag filled Billy Dilly full of lead, he blew his own dick off in the process? After all, Billy Dilly was presumably still slobbering on his head when Stag opened fire. Thanks for taking the time to consider this question. 
SLIM LEE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA
Dear Slim Lee, 
During my more gloomy moments I sometimes wonder if anyone actually listens to my lyrics, and whether the enormous amount of work I put into them may in fact go unheeded. So it was with very real gratitude that I read this question, as you had clearly reflected long and hard on the matter. I am very moved, to be honest. On my knees, I thank you (but not in that way).
I didn’t even have to look at the address of this question to know that you were from Melbourne. We Melburnians are warped but meticulous thinkers and, I would tentatively suggest, a step ahead of everyone else. Our minds simply jump the leash and run, unchecked and slavering, where others fear to tread. 
It did occur to me one night, as I performed Stagger Lee in full priapic flight, that Stagger Lee does not shoot Billy Dilly with an actual gun at all, but that his being "filled full of lead. Bang! Bang! Bang!” was simply a metaphor for the force of Stag’s ejaculation, and Blixa’s terrifying and inhuman screeching at the end orgasmic in nature. This made me wonder, chillingly at the time, what sleeping with Blixa must be like – something I am sadly unable to elaborate on. 
Beyond that, my friend, I have nothing more to add, but if any more theories about my songs work their way into your beautiful mind, perhaps on one of those warm and eerie Melbourne nights, where the fruit bats fly from tree to tree, please do not hesitate to write in and tell me. I would love that.
Love, Nick

We also make up a lot of songs to tunes of pop songs. Bad pop songs. You’d think “You’re Having My Baby” would be number one but I don’t actually know enough words to make it funny.

Went to see the band Ricky’s in these days because they finally played a matinee show. He was born to this kind of thing. It’s not a genre I love, but this band does it as well as anyone. I don’t mean that as a backhanded compliment. Just that they’re good at their thing. They’re called Horsehead.

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re:
</b> <br><br> Yeah, recently. John Gotschalk just told me this afternoon. John and I have achieved a bit of a rapprochement, I guess. John and I — along with a couple thousand other people — were at the unveiling of this incredible sculpture. that now stands in front of the VMFA.  (It debuted in NY, was moved down and installed last week then covered with a tarp that made it look like a Christo piece.) The governor and mayor spoke and a curator and Kehinde Wiley's gallery rep and so on. Then Wiley spoke very movingly. 

Then they tried to pull the tarp off but it got stuck on the rider's hair. I think they hadn't calculated how heavy the drape would be after being rained on all day. So several people yanked at the thing but to no avail. The sculpture is 30' tall. They tried various strategies but nothing. The crowd was so amped and then...this embarrassing disappointment. Someone came on the PA and invited everyone to come into the museum. Nobody moved. Eventually a couple guys brought a ladder and propped it up against the massive stone base of the statue. Nobody should climb a wet ladder propped against a brand new wet statue. But some guy did, carrying a 15' telescoping pole with him. He tried to undo the tarp, but no dice. So they extended the ladder another eight feet or so. Now the guy's at the top of the ladder — way north of the fulcrum it's leaning on — and he's standing on one of the upper rungs, fiddling with the pole but not making any progress. I was convinced he would soon slide off the ladder and either die or become a quadriplegic. More anticlimax, though — he did neither. Just climbed down and gave up.

Then a fireman climbed up the ladder and started hacking away at the tarp with a knife. It was like a circus act. After a few minutes, he cut the thing loose and the statue was revealed to lots of hooting and applause. This debacle lasted close to an hour. A marching band played the entire time. People standing in the rain watching this. Like, everyone I've known from around for forever. And thousands more. At the beginning of the event I think many of us felt we were experiencing a moment of transition, and maybe we were. But several people made the comment that, "Richmond is almost great. It's just THIS CLOSE."

I'll probably avoid the Kevin Barry book! That shit has always scared me.

Thanks about Chad. I will get in touch with him.

</b> <br><br> I’ve been busting my ass getting ready for this talk I’m giving on Saturday called The Essential Song which a this thing I’ve been thinking about for a couple years but never putting the time in to actually make a thing. It’s about what the bare minimum information that makes a song a song. But having heard this Jeremy Renner song, I might have to rethink. Behold its lyrics:

She's got the voodoo that'll make you believe
Oh, she tastes like lipstick and Tanqueray
All I remember is she grew up in Atlanta
But she moved to the Bay
An uptown beauty you could never escape
Heaven don't have a name
She keeps it old school
Feels like rock and roll, but got that new groove
So unpredictable, I gotta tell you, I'll never be the same
'Cause Heaven don't have a name (have a name)
Oh oh oh (hey, hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
I hear they call her danger, she's looking for a cheap shot
She'll always be a stranger dancing to the jukebox
All I remember is she grew up in Atlanta
But she moved to the Bay
An uptown beauty you could never escape
Heaven don't have a name
She keeps it old school
Feels like rock and roll, but got that new groove
So unpredictable, I gotta tell you, I'll never be the same
'Cause Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey, hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey, hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Can call her what you want but she's the liar, no
If you can brave her love she'll give you fire, oh
Keep it old school
Throws on Billie Jean 'cause she ain't no fool
She can be my beauty queen
I gotta tell you, I'll never be the same
Heaven don't have a name
(Hey, hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey, hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name
Oh oh oh (hey)
Halo, halo
Heaven don't have a name</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yes. The lyrics are a pastiche of IMITATIONS of clichés. It’s like they were written by the last person in a game of telephone where the original story was “here’s what rock lyrics were meant to be a long time ago.” I dunno. What awful, dangerous garbage nonsense. 

The regional Governor’s arts school has an annual writers’ fest where they invite half a dozen people from around here to give workshops. The thing is attended by students and by adults in the area. I expect maybe 20 people at mine. 

My idea is that the “Essential Song” is independent of performance, performer, arrangement, production, and so on. It can be plausibly represented by a lead sheet. It’s the bare information that constitutes a song. It’s not an ambience or a vibe or the unique sound of a band. Like if a song were a computer program, the Essential Song would run that program with the fewest lines of code, the smallest possible number of zeroes and ones. I’m saying that it exists in the overlap of three domains: melody, harmony, and poetry. Am making a case for excluding rhythm from that list. I’ll use some familiar tunes for demonstrating how fucking with these three things changes a song’s nature. 

The point being that it’s like a platonic ideal of a song and that framing how one listens to—or writes—songs through that filter is a pretty good way to get better at listening and writing. 

The second half of my thing will be a series of increasingly mystical instructions for writing a song. I will admit at the outset that anyone who claims to have a list of useful songwriting instructions is either a moron or a charlatan. My list is a sprawling flow chart kind of thing. I’m totally serious about its content but hope it comes across as at least a little funny. The first step is reading novels and a little poetry and listening for songs not just that you love but which seem to love you back. It moves through some practical steps and some incantations to the muse that basically constitute begging. Throwing a ball for a dog is an integral part of the approach. 

Anyway it’s stuff I’ve been thinking about for awhile, making notes and stuff, but this deadline has helped me get motivated. It’s fun, and it helps me when I’m stuck.  And I can see how one hour will barely allow the introduction of the relevant topics which is encouraging because I’d like to expand this into an ongoing larger project. 

Any questions / critiques would be heartily appreciated! I’d like to not sound like a blowhard!</br></br>

</b> <br><br> 😢 (tears of humble gratitude)

Ya know, I have this big idea about what I want to do with TB&TH...it’s a hybrid band show / one-person drama / poetry / dance thing.  And so I looked up Creative Capital a month or so ago. Read through a bunch of stuff. And concluded that I don’t have enough under my belt to approach them just yet. I didn’t want to bring it up because I was a little embarrassed and do not want to get ahead of myself. 

I’ve also been looking into the artist colonies—MacDowell, Yaddo, Virginia Center for Creative Arts. But I just don’t have a body of work to show. If I could use “shit tons of therapy” as an “artistic achievement” or “not killing myself,” then maybe I’d feel more qualified. 

But at the same time I sure hope I can make some hay while the sun is shining. 

Any and all advice about this big picture stuff is very deeply appreciated.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Thank you for all these thoughts.

I would very much appreciate having a look at your application. I can't really imagine laughing at it at all, let alone too hard. But please, yes, I'd like to see that.

Everything you said about coping with mental illness as an integral aspect of my self in the world is accurate, and gradually adopting that view is one of the things that has helped me manage for the past few years. It's encouraging to hear someone else reflect that in an unsolicited way. I'm not sure I've ever mentioned this so directly, but the specific disorder I'm treated for is called dissociative identity disorder which is, of course, better known in the movies as multiple personality. My specific case is less dramatic than Tyler Durden's, but the profound quality of a self not knowing itself is familiar territory. One of the big picture things I'm dreaming of with TB&TH is a story that reverses the standard multiple personality reveal. The story I'd like to create would begin with the audience knowing the protagonist is more than one self while he's clueless. The story would be about that person learning to have compassion for himself (his selves). All of which I bring up because the way you were framing what my approach to places like Creative Capital could be felt right...and familiar. So thank you.

<b> Dec 18, 2019, at 6:32 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> How did people respond to the mystical angle?

We're doing okay. Had a rough night getting Ewan to sleep so we're dragging. But it's not so bad. We just got back from a trip to Seattle to show him off to friends and family. He did great on that trip. We're like: Sweet, he can fly, let's go to Europe! (Not sure how a long flight would go but now Alison's fired up.)

Man, did I tell you about Angus's assplosion in the hotel during our exploratory getaway to Los Alamos, CA? Poor guy. Sorry if I told you this, I can't remember anything anymore. Sleep dep,. But we drove up to Los Alamos, a little wine town a couple hours away. We like this hipsterized old place, the Alamo Motel, which has a fire pit in the middle area of the horseshoe-shaped parking area. People (are forced to) hand by the fire, share drinks, meet. Angus met this great dog that was a perfect match in temperament, they ripped around for like two hours. But then they drank out of a little fountain there before we could stop him. It was our fault, we failed to bring out his water dish. But I knew that would be trouble. He has a super sensitive gut. He bugged me to go out several times during the night but the last time I was asleep and didn't hear him whine. He shat all over the bathroom floor (tile). Thank God it wasn't on the rug in the main area. He's smart that way. He was obviously so ashamed but we felt terrible for him. I wanted to badly to say it was my fault. His English isn't quite that good though. We only feed him the dog food we know is safe, plus the occasional scrap. Poor guy.

</b> <br><br> Poor Angus! What a good boy for going on the tile. Yeah it’s such a terrible feeling when you feel like you’ve poisoned your dog. It was somehow especially poignant the other day when Fuzz was all gurgly and he just wanted to snuggle. Like, if he understood that it was my fault would he have been so forgiving. Probably. I guess it’s in their natures.

Not sure specifically about how the mystical parts went over. I looked out over the room full mostly of teenagers and for the most part saw straightforward acceptance of any claim I made. Like, I’d give instructions for an incantation of gratitude to the muse, and they’d be dutifully taking notes. Maybe half a dozen hung around to keep talking when it was over, which felt good. Their songwriting struggles seem pretty similar to my own, but like, I dunno…they have less context for what it is to them? I enjoyed it, felt purposeful.

Hey, did you see an email from me about a week ago about the Creative Capital stuff? In it I said, yes—please do send me your application if you can get your hands on it.

I hope Ewan slept better last night!</br></br>

<b> Dec 19, 2019, at 12:39 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I’m not sure how helpful this will really be. But it’s a start. If you decide to apply, I’d definitely talk to them and get some guidance. And if you have friends who work in fine / performing arts who may speak the lingo and/or have written grants before, or at least read the applications, get that help too.

I’m just throwing in the budgets so you can see what they look like. CCFinalBudget is what we turned in with our application. It was educated guesswork. NITRATEBUDGET is the actual budget of the show — you don’t need to turn this in, obviously, since you won’t know it but it’s instructive to compare maybe.

<b> Dec 28, 2019, at 9:35 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> No worries, man. We have a baby. Everything takes ten times longer. 

The Christmas was pretty good. We did a Xmas Eve cocktail party for whoever was still around, so that was fun. Had to get up a couple times in the night to deal with Ewan, plus was a tad hungover, then got up at like 7 to pee and wanted to go back to bed (more from sleep dep than hangover, but still), which caused Alison to cry. I was flummoxed. She figured out today that it was related to being with her dad on Christmas mornings and he’d be actually pro-level hungover and not get up til noon. So there was a touch of emotional trauma to it. Which I was glad to learn because I couldn’t figure out what I’d done wrong. But Christmas itself was cool. We opened presents, mostly for Ewan, made breakfast, called the relatives, and so on. It’s funny, now that I’m married with a baby, my sister calls me a lot more often. Maybe she has more to talk about or can relate to me better or something. To be fair, she is a fount of info on baby stuff. 

We just watched the first two Letterkennys of S8. Less is more with Letterkenny but they were still funny. On some Letterkenny subreddit or somewhere I saw the question posed: Were Wayne and Katy raised Mennonite? I think they were. It makes sense. No birthday parties or TV, all the old traditional sayings, always helping anyone who asks, and their various methods of rebelling (Wayne: fighting; Katy: fucking). 

I’m getting over a cold. First it was unemployment, then it was the holidays, and finally it was a cold — but everything fell into place for me to read the Lord of the Rings again in its entirety. Love those guys.

</b> <br><br> Well, I just read your Creative Capital application. Thanks again for sending it. The notion that I’d find anything laughable there was kinda crazy. Reading that application is both inspiring and intimidating — you’d already accomplished so much by then. It’s helpful to see the language of their questions and your successful answers to them. I’m just starting to think along these kinds of lines. Have been working on an “artist statement” with the help of an online guide, which is humbling. There’s nothing like submitting one’s half-baked ideas to a goofy external discipline to highlight how far one has to go! So I think I’ll use CC’s application as a framework but probably won’t submit anything in February.

Also, I’d forgotten an essential component of the Nitrate Hymnal — that it takes place in reverse. So I feel kind of chagrinned about the multiple-personality-reveal-in-reverse idea I mentioned. "Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief?”

Natalie, Jacob, and I are watching the Lord of the Rings movies over the course of six nights. They’ve seen everything (especially Jacob who’s kind of a movie buff) but had somehow never seen those movies. I recalled to them that I saw the first one at the end of its run with you (I think)  at the Janus, which I remember people alternately calling “The Anus” and “The Free Theater” because they always left their alley door unlocked. The screen was tiny, and smooth jazz from the lobby was playing from an overhead speaker the entire time. I complained, and the manager just kinda shrugged.

That story about Alison on Christmas morning. For years in therapy with Jean she’d suggest that some anniversary or half-forgotten experience was affecting my present mindset, and I’d accuse her of playing emotional pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. As in, “you’re really reaching for an explanation, Jean.” But now I think she was pretty much always correct, and that memory gets coded in, and that when the line of code runs again in the future, it brings its associated emotions to the fore as though they originated in the present. So I feel for Alison. Christmas morning is bound to be a bit rough. But I also feel for you since that must’ve felt pretty mystifying. I’m glad there was some clarity.

For my part, I fucking hate Christmas. I mean I just basically hate the entire thing. If I could I’d go somewhere non-christian for November, December, and January. I mean, I don’t want to spoil “the magic” for anyone else. I just don’t want to participate at all.

On the other hand, I bet it’s cool to have Christmas with a baby!

Interesting about Wayne and Katy.</br></br>

<b> Dec 30, 2019, at 12:14 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I can't swear to it but I think I stole the reverse idea from Sondheim's "Merrily We Roll Along." Or MEMENTO, not sure.

The thing about my "accomplishments" is that the whole thing felt like I was scamming them. I just played in some bands and shit. Jean Cook taught me that it all counts if you phrase it correctly. Like, I sure as fuck never called Punk Not Rock a "salon" until we put together this application. It was a lot of revisionist history, or felt like it. I was just doing my thing. It wasn't "approved" by the art world powers, as it were. But I guess it turned out that they have a boner for "authenticity." Or that's how I read it. 

This is the best aggregator of grants for individuals that I know of: http://source.nyfa.org/content/search/search.aspx?SA=1

Also you can get fiscal sponsorship from Fractured Atlas or other outfits if you want to apply for grants that don't award to individuals. I once heard a professional grant writer say that she basically never failed to get any grant she applied for because she only applied for ones that actually fit the bill. (Which is just nuts.) But the moral is: don't waste energy applying for grants that don't quite fit what you're doing. And you can call them to ask if your project fits their mandate. They will be kind and tell you. And if it does they will help you apply in such a way that you have the best chance.

Jeez, the Janus. I hadn't thought of that place in ages. Why was it even in business? I like those LOTR movies okay -- and I give Peter Jackson props for getting so much right -- but the books convey some kind of almost Anglican vibe that I find somehow comforting. No idea why. 

I've found it pretty hard to find magic in Christmas as an adult. The whole thing feels like a bludgeon. I do remember once when I was a kid my mom banished the colored lights and instead got these fake candles for the windows. It changed the whole air of the thing to something that actually felt sacred somehow. That was a pretty rare event. I wonder what would be the place that you could escape Christmas? Bora Bora? Iceland? Vietnam?

I basically enjoyed Knives Out as well. I like that it turned the drawing room murder mystery inside out. I think Alison was less satisfied and wanted a standard whodunnit. But she's a dirty philistine. You seen JoJo Rabbit? Man, that's good stuff.

Man, Billie Holiday. So, short story long, I made $0 this last year. That's a record low for me. I've had many years where I made an embarrassingly low amount of money but this is almost like an art project. I'm married to Alison who makes legit adult money and so things aren't desperate. But my ego has taken a hard look in the mirror. Billie was supposed to pay me to write a pilot script but then the production company, White Horse, made a deal with Ron Howard's big fancy powerful production company, Imagine Entertainment, to come onboard. And because Tessa is attached and under a deal at HBO, HBO had to have the first dibs on it. They hemmed and hawed for much of the year but finally passed. I wrote a whole detailed breakdown of what's true / fictional for them, to ease their concerns (which was a dubious premise as their Chernobyl mini-series takes precisely the same kind of liberties in service of telling the greater truth) but it didn't do the trick. They passed but let Tessa do it elsewhere. So now Imagine is trying to attach a senior writer (aka a showrunner) who is ideally female and black to help shepherd this thing. Once that's done, I think we'll take it out to networks. Pretty sure someone will go for it (even though Lee Daniels is doing a feature film on the same premise, which doesn't worry anyone much since there are no stars and he doesn't have rights to the music as we have them sewed up for years). But the other course may be that Imagine pays me to write the pilot script (and absorbs the older pilot deal) first, possibly along with the showrunner, to strengthen the package. White Horse knows I'm pissed that it's taken so long without me getting paid the rest of my dough (which was itself only a portion of what I would eventually negotiate from the eventual buyer for the script). But in any case it feels like the coming year could bring all this home. Who knows, it could all disintegrate too. But Imagine, at least, is serious about getting this done, which is heartening. But also: goddamn, y'all.

I wouldn't rule out Morocco. Once you get there it's cheap as dirt. Also we want to go back, so maybe there's a combo plan. 

Is QLab a souped-up version of Max/MSP? I remember being blown away by what you could do with Max but I also know I don't even have the patience to twiddle tone knobs on my guitar amp, so it seemed unlikely I'd dive in.

Susan, the idea that songs are prophetic is the kind of magical thinking which I would normally reject, but there has been too much coincidence, too often, not to feel that some songs perhaps hold a certain unsettling knowledge, beyond the understanding of their creators. I suspect we all have intimations or intuitions, that are holding conversations with the future, but that we tend to disregard, perhaps at our peril. As songwriters we are given scraps of information - images, visions, projections, divination - that become the building blocks for songs; these uncanny hunches are the stuff we work with, the material with which we create, so the songs end up feeling elastic, stretching themselves forward in time and back into the past. They can feel like preternatural witnesses to things yet to come, signallers calling urgently from an emergency - the future - while haunted by what has gone before.</br></br>

I was never 100% clear what Max/MSP actually did, despite messing with it some. QLab is what I wanted all along. At its core, it just handles cues. Most of the examples and tutorials are for live theater. Like, you need a phone to ring. You need it to stop ringing when the character picks it up. You need a train whistle right in the middle of a silence between two speaking turns. Or you need to cut to a projection of video being captured by a camera down the street, and you need titles on it. They smartly made the interface look and act a lot like Logic or Final Cut. Unfortunately, it’s $999! But the free version is cool to mess around with.

Speaking of theater stuff, I’m trying to get my hands on Big Time, and it’s surprisingly hard. Hoping to get the VHS (there aren’t legit DVDs and it’s not streaming) from interlibrary loan at the public library. I’ve watched clips on YouTube but want to see it all. Remember the stuff he does with props…simple, old-timey gimmicks? Like throwing feathers around or lighting himself with a bare bulb? Didn’t you say that when you saw him in New York he stamped his feet in a powder that looked like smoke? I love all that stuff.

I’m plugging away at responding to the Creative Capital questions as a way to dream about what I want to do band-wise.

I’d be interested in your critique of it if you were willing, but totally fine if you’d rather not, too.</br></br>

Did you watch BIG TIME yet? I’m totally gonna watch that again, even though that version is pretty grainy. I saw it ages ago but I don’t remember when. Maybe after college? So weird that it’s not available anywhere. I saw old mentions of it on Netflix from like seven years ago. Must be some licensing tiff. I noticed that Anti- has now licensed and re-pressed his old Asylum records.

ScarJo was SO GOOD in that movie. Like, her best work yet. Man, it gutted me when he found her hanged. Fuck. Like, I’m a professional and should have seen that coming but I didn’t. Oof. Everyone was good in that. Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson = hilarious. All those kids were incredible. Man, I just love this shit out of Taika Waititi too. We’ve probably discussed but I put on WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS one day on a lark. I just died. Same for HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE. 

The main think I worked on while waiting for everything else was this feature about Buster Keaton. Did I tell you about that already?

My mom came to visit over the weekend. It was good. But it’s always surreal with her. You can’t ever tell if she wants to be there. It’s possible that she wants to and doesn’t want to simultaneously, hence the dissonance. She was glad to meet Ewan. Unlike with Alison’s mom, though, there was no indication that she would ever want to, like, babysit or anything. Even a return visit seemed pretty tentative. I just try to take the high road now with her. Just be pleasant and sociable and not bring up anything that would cause trouble.

Feel free to send your artist statement, etc. Happy to have a look. No idea if I have any special insight or that I know how to do it right.</br></br>

<b> Jan 9, 2020, at 7:49 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> You’ve told me about the Buster Keaton story. How’s that going?

The script is done. My reps gave it to Bill Hader to read in hopes he’ll star / direct. There hasn’t been a response that I’m aware of. He probably hasn’t read it or they would give a response. But since it’s been a few weeks they’re sending to producers. But we’ll discuss a gameplan pretty soon, I think. The truth is, this would probably require a particular confluence of factors to get headway. Some powerful godfather to champion it, some physical comic actor who sees awards potential, some director with the right sensibility. These kinds of movies do get made sometimes but I’m not totally sure how.


About the artist statement. Some caveats. First, I started with this as an exercise to see if I (a) really had a point of view to articulate and (b) could articulate it. It’s an attempt to answer the WHAT, WHY, and HOW of my overall project. I doubt I’ll ever use it in this form, but I do think that it’s a baseline for stuff I’ll say about what I’m working on. 

Secondly, I’m asking for you to critique it with no gloves on. Almost nobody is willing to do this. Yet I’m always better off having vetted my ideas than I am going it alone.  I know I have two Achilles heels: self-pity and pretentiousness, and I don’t want this to be characterized by either. However, I may have other liabilities I’m not aware of, and I’d like to become aware of them. Basically: Is this thing sensible or not? Is it clear? Does it belabor the obvious? Does it raise questions that it should be answering? Should anything be cut? Or added? Other reactions or ideas?


I think this is a strong start. I don’t feel any self-pity here. Nor pretentiousness. Though I think these artist statements sort of require some pretensions by their very nature, but different pretentions than what you’re talking about. An artist analyzing their own work and process is inherently fucking nauseating, but a requirement.

Bear in mind I don’t know how to write one of these either. Not really. So anything I write here is a suggestion more as a pro writer and less as someone with an inside track to grant money. It’s more intuition than actual knowledge.

I might write it a bit more like a narrative, at least in the opening. A la: “When I began writing songs as a teenager, I was [simply trying to emulate my heroes REM, or whatever, with the purpose of the songs being somewhat less deep than now, etc etc]. I was Berklee-trained as a jazz guitarist but I gravitated to pop because it was cooler. My band found early success, with releases on tastemaker label Spin Art Records, and others. But that early succeess was for the wrong reasons and became crippling. As did my health issues. I dropped out of music, which is my chosen medium and first love, as a means of self preservation. [Or whatever. Spitballing.] Sporadic restarts over the years received acclaim but worsened my spiral. The breakthrough came [describe] after a number of false starts and years of intensive therapy. Finally I could see through the glib reassurances of my early work and the music it was aping. Finally, I understood [music as therapeutic practice, but also its ability to communicate credible messages of hope. [CMOH definition here. Maybe spin CMOH as a clinical term / phenonenon, not just a pollyanna-ish pretty sentiment. And that survivors of trauma and abuse require CMOH to survive. Etc.]”

Make CMOH a socio-political issue like gender / ethnic representation. A thing that doctors and scientists recognize. But that music is uniquely qualified to convey. Make it hard for the reader to deny your social relevance as a member of an identity group, trauma survivors.

I would go into how you take the familiar forms and tropes of the love song and turn them on their head / invert them / deconstruct them / whatever, then reimagine them as narratives of survival and community / communion and whatever with the purpose of not just romantic or erotic connection but the difficult process of learning to love one’s own being and existence, which is psychotherapy's goal in treating trauma survivors. Or whatever. Point being you’re canny and doing something clever and interrogating the form itself.

Don’t lay it on too thick but give the artworld people something they recognize and can sink their teeth into.

I like all the stuff you wrote, in general. But you could make it more pointed. “Hope has been my central preoccupation as a trauma survivor and as an artist.” And give an example of the “false hope” that you’re referring to. Like in treacly love songs, for instance. I might also set up the “missing god” thing with some mention of how the notion of hope has gone from a widely accepted theological truism to a Nietzschean punchline, or whatever.

I agree with Valley’s comments too. 

But on the whole I think this is a strong start. Don’t tart it up too much. But keep kneading it.

Holler with questions.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I can't remember if I mentioned it at the time, but about a year ago I was messing with the Vocoder in Logic and remembered that you'd used one in Windows on the World. So I sat down and listened to it and was gobsmacked. I just sat there and wept. That song is about as credible a message of hope as any I've encountered. 

It sure does seem like ideas / beliefs / intuitions emerge in songwriting (and poetry, too) that seem almost like breadcrumbs that lead to a future self state. It's super interesting to hear you describe how that's happened to you. This thing you said, especially: From one POV, it’s like by my channelling Jesus I wound up bestowing grace on myself. But from another, more mystical, POV it’s like Jesus bestowed the song and the sentiment and the grace on me.

I really see both of those points of view, and they're both beautiful and reassuring. I've come to believe (in my own case) that the second thought—that the song and its grace are bestowed on me from elsewhere—is really how it works. My creativity only began to get at all generous or humane once I admitted that it was beyond the control of my will (as far as inspiration goes—not in terms of sitting my ass down and working), and that I was going to kill myself unless I could find a better relationship with whatever force was in charge of inspiration. I've done what the 12-step people recommend for those who have a hard time naming their higher power, and I've dedicated myself to the muse Calliope, the one who oversees epic poetry and whose name means "beautiful voice." I did it on a lark, and was half kidding about it when I began to ask her for ideas if she cared to use me to move them from her world into this one. But over the past couple of years, I've seen that it's no joke. My helplessness...my being forced into a humbled position...into becoming a penitent and choosing a kooky faith is why this part of my life has started making sense. 

I don't mean to sound insulting, like I'm comparing your long and abiding faith in Jesus with this...mystical technique I've adopted. The thing is that I realize I'm probably describing another step in my own weird crypto christian path. And that feels comforting.

The song I wrote about Chesley had these weird lines in it I didn't quite know why I included at the time. "We both know that fools rush in / We both know there is wisdom in many voices" and "before the complications / only bliss." It's almost as if I knew what was going to happen at the same time that I kinda thought for sure I'd finally found real love. Also, in that song I focus on a bunch of visually beautiful images that I associated with her. All these years later, one of the things I am grateful for about my time with how she affected my sense of what's beautiful. She would sometimes say she was "feeling looky" and would flip through books of victorian wallpaper or a certain kind of Japanese pottery or whatever. She had a real sensitive eye, and it changed me for the better. Anyway, it's all in that song...beautiful surfaces...some beautiful sensitivity below those surfaces...and collapse.

I’m psyched that Melissa sounds so good to you. I remember what you said about how a mediocre violinist can really fuck shit up, and it’s a relief to me that all this passes that test! I mean, I think so, but my ear is biased now. Also, her sight reading slays me. I’ll walk in with some new part thinking it’s complicated, and she’ll read it the first time like it’s a Dr. Seuss book.

Dude. I had that happen to me one time in particular, which I’m sure I’ve shared with you, but GRB played the Knitting Factory and as usual I was cobbling together players and I somehow got this guy Adam Gold to play drums. He was friends of friends. I didn’t know what to expect because I gave him a CD like the day before. I had Jean and Durst, I think. And this guy just DESTROYED. No practice. Totally macked all those weird skittery parts on the first record. Nailed every nuance. Impeccable timing. I was so freaked out that it almost made me fuck things up. Now, that wasn’t sight reading, it was listening to a finished CD, but damn, the guy did it overnight. I’ll bet he only listened like twice, too. Those are the kind of players that just recalibrate my ego.

I’ve learned to keep the drums and guitar minimal on the demos because whatever Greg and Ben come up with will exceed anything I can do.

This was exactly the advice I was given by people at Bang On A Can. Well, percussion really. I do think drummers inhabit a different world and you wouldn’t teach a fish to swim. But I was glad to hear someone say it for even highly notated music.

We call the practice recordings, “the dailies.” 

I love this.

On the second part of this song I’ve wanted something specific that has been hard to communicate. It’s mostly based on certain string and flute parts from Astral Weeks and Veedon Fleece. Where people are almost soloing over one another. I tried playing half a dozen cues from those records. Didn’t help. I tried comparing it to dixieland stuff. Didn’t help. Everyone just kept playing the way they already were. Then finally I asked them to imagine being in a meadow on a sunny day. Bees and butterflies are taking off and landing and fluttering around. I asked them to emulate the insects and to use no divisions of the beat longer than an 8th note. This was the take where they began to hear what I was hearing. I can’t wait to see what a week has done to this one! I plan to keep pushing them this way before we dial back in.

Man. That is so fucking interesting. That’s great. So funny to play those things for high order musicians and they probably only hear the actual melodic lines or something. But describe a scene with the correct detail and they get it.

You know that story, right, that a lot of that orchestration on Astral Weeks was added after the fact without Van’s prior knowledge? I don’t know the whole story but apparently he was pissed at first. But then wisely leaned into it. I need to find the details on that. But of course these were the same references I was making a lot in doing the first GRB record.</br></br>

I’m psyched that Melissa sounds so good to you. I remember what you said about how a mediocre violinist can really fuck shit up, and it’s a relief to me that all this passes that test! I mean, I think so, but my ear is biased now. Also, her sight reading slays me. I’ll walk in with some new part thinking it’s complicated, and she’ll read it the first time like it’s a Dr. Seuss book.

I do not play guitar at all, and it is not a temptation. Sometimes I think the guitar is my albatross. I sing twice as well when I’m not playing, and I can inhabit what I’m singing in a way that I now see is how it’s supposed to be. I am playing guitar and singing in a second project, and I’m having trouble staying in the moment. I play constantly at home.

I write the songs, record demos, make charts, then share with everyone in our group thread. I’ve learned to keep the drums and guitar minimal on the demos because whatever Greg and Ben come up with will exceed anything I can do. The keyboard player usually wants me to sketch his parts out, but everything he does is also much better than what I can do. I develop the violin and French horn / trumpet parts in Logic then notate them in Sibelius. Everyone shows up having listened to the demo and at least having the chords under their fingers. We practice in Doyle’s basement, and he records everything. Doyle’s one of those rock-solid minimalist bass players who idolizes the studio players of Motown, Stax, Muscle Shoals. He mixes the best takes from practice and usually sends them to the group thread within 24 hours. We call the practice recordings, “the dailies.” By the following week we’ve all tried to learn from the dailies how to improve.

My job in practice seems to be making the big decisions (which is not super comfortable) and trying to help people do their best. They’re extremely different people and need different things. I’m pretty sure they don’t all like each other, which is irritating but probably helpful.

On the second part of this song I’ve wanted something specific that has been hard to communicate. It’s mostly based on certain string and flute parts from Astral Weeks and Veedon Fleece. Where people are almost soloing over one another. I tried playing half a dozen cues from those records. Didn’t help. I tried comparing it to dixieland stuff. Didn’t help. Everyone just kept playing the way they already were. Then finally I asked them to imagine being in a meadow on a sunny day. Bees and butterflies are taking off and landing and fluttering around. I asked them to emulate the insects and to use no divisions of the beat longer than an 8th note. This was the take where they began to hear what I was hearing. I can’t wait to see what a week has done to this one! I plan to keep pushing them this way before we dial back in.</br></br>

<b> Jan 20, 2020, at 12:57 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Man, you really have some ringers in that band if this is your second go-round on this song. I have to say, there are few things as dispiriting to me as a just-okay violinist (because I’m ruined by Jean Cook) and your violinist sounds perfect. I can’t remember, do you play guitar at all in this band? Is it a temptation? You're the primary architect of these songs, right — that is how do the others figure in?

I feel like I’m only catching about 2/3 of the words — no crime, just a function of the recording process — so I’m eager to hear the more pristine version of this. It just seems great.  Like a painter who’s spent their whole life at the easel, just finally banging out greatness.</br></br>

Since you’ll soon be living in the same place, do similar work, and because good people ought to know one another when possible, I thought you should meet. Caroline, Bob is one of my oldest friends. Bob, I know and admire Caroline from my writing community. My guess is that you and your respective spouses would hit it off.

</b> <br><br> I did not know that about those arrangements on Astral Weeks. Wow. I did look for info about them, but didn’t find that story…or anything useful. I guess some dude named Jeff Labes (according to Wikipedia) worked on the ones on Veedon Fleece, and I chased that lead for a while, but to no avail. I wish those scores — and all of those scores, like from hits of that era — were available. A person could learn so much from them. 

I’d love to see the arrangements from Scott 3. Those have to exist somewhere, right? 

That’s super surprising about the Bang On A Can advice. So it was for drummers / percussionists? Did they mean tuned percussion, too? I know enough about writing music to know that I know almost zero. Melissa always helps me with the parts I write. The trumpet / horn dude simply won’t do anything unless it’s on the page. Yet he’s capable of so much shit I don’t even know exists.

I don’t know what’s with the Adam Golds of the world. I have a theory that there’s some kind of mechanism in the brain that’s different for real virtuosos. Like when you’re a kid and your friend has a go-kart and you figure out how to modify “the governor” to make it go faster. It’s like the virtuoso’s governor isn’t there. You can almost watch them entering a flow state, and they almost always seem physically relaxed while they’re doing it. There’s no amount of practice I could do in a lifetime to touch the hem of that garment. Happily I no longer care. I think my thing might be making a meal of scraps from here and there.

In other news, there’s this massive gun rights march here today. In the days leading up to it the FBI arrested people in Maryland and in Georgia who were planning on coming here and trying to help start “The Boogaloo,” which is what they call The Civil War Part Two. I read that "The Boogaloo" is a reference to “Breakin’ Two: Electric Boogaloo.” The thing is —I was heartened by the FBI busts. If our situation was any worse, I could imagine resources being shifted away from the hate group beat within law enforcement. Anyway, the neo nazi guys that got busted are members of “The Base,” which is a translation of "Al Qaeda.”  

People have come from all over the country for this event. Everyone I know was freaked out and worried. So far, no violence. It’s really cold today which probably helped. Look at these guys:</br></br>

<b> Jan 21, 2020, at 4:31 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> My friend Jeff who told me about the Astral Weeks thing is trying to track down where he got that info. Will advise.

I heard an interview once from the arranger for a bunch of those Scott records. Can’t remember the name but was totally fucking snooty about it. Just dismissive, thought it was pop nonsense. But yeah, I’d think somewhere those charts exist. And for Astral Weeks too. Especially since I saw Van when he came through the Hollywood Bowl a few years ago to do Astral Weeks in full. I was skeptical but I have to admit it was great. They recreated it, so someone has charts.

As for BOAC, I don’t know that they were talking about melodic components as with tuned percussion, more just the high order rhythmic sense of drummers / percussionists as compares to your usual composer’s. 

You sent me that photo from the gun march and my instinctive thought was: “What a bunch of adolescent dipshits."</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Cool re. Astral Weeks. Thanks.

Those gun dudes. Sheesh. I know what you mean about adolescents. I remember when I was 10 thinking I was gonna fuck up some bad guys like I was the karate kid or whatever.

I heard from Chad today. Am gonna meet him next Tuesday. Awesome!

I ended up reading part of that book by the guy who made that dorky book trailer I sent you. It was deep! I found the chapter about an arranger names Michael Gibbs. The book went into all this detail about Gibbs’ use of these weird scales developed by Messiaen. The examples were notated and annotated. It was super interesting.  EXCEPT for that all the examples came from some horrible Elton John record where he’s doing Cole Porter and stuff with various guest stars. I mean just the worst dreck. It cracked me up to think of someone writing such highbrow parts for such lowbrow pandering nonsense.</br></br>

<b> Jan 22, 2020, at 12:43 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I have so many thoughts.

A) STOKED to hear about your meeting with Chad. I love Chad, and you guys (and me) share a lot of musical tastes and sensibilities. He will pretty much know any reference you make. So feel encouraged to dive deep. I think he is really going to get that there's this thing you're going for. That's pretty much the m.o. for all of us, and he specializes in trying to capture it.

Also, I don't know what your actual plans are for making this recording but don't be afraid to enlist Chad if you think it's a good idea. I mean, he needs to get paid some dough, but he also has been known to sort of employ the sliding scale of artistic worthiness. And he made everything I did better and really has an editor's ear and had lots of cool ideas. (I didn't take all of them, but still.)

B) I've never heard of Michael Gibbs before but that dude has records on both ECM *and* Cuneiform. So he's cool. Or a super dork. Probably cool though. Also he scored a John Woo movie, which is hilarious. Also didn't you also go to Berklee? I mean, you sealed your doom right there. Also also, MY GOD the very idea of Elton Fucking John doing Cole Porter. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH.

C) We rented this house in the desert and they had a turntable and some records and one of them was this early Elton John record where in the photos he was this pudgy balding British dork and there were no discernable hits on it. I just googled it and it's called Rock of the Westies. The photo on the back is just priceless. It looks like he hired some L.A. session guys, all of whom seem so "cool," and here he is this total dorkus who I see at my local coffee shop twice a week right now today.

</b> <br><br> Yes! Sorry for the delay. Yesterday was eaten up by a number of inessential tasks. And also watching “Persona” for the first time. I guess I’d say it's the most vivid depiction of dissociative mental illness I’ve ever seen. It was one of those moments when you’re experiencing something someone else has made but it feels autobiographical.

Anyhoo.

Meeting Chad was so great. First of all, what a great guy. Ya know, I seldom hit it off with men. Never have had an easy time with them. So it was just a pleasure to feel so at ease. We talked for two hours. I don’t know about him, but I could’ve kept gabbing. I never want to talk to someone I’ve just met for two hours. So aside from talking about music stuff, I was just glad to meet the guy. In terms of music stuff, I left the conversation feeling very encouraged. It seems like a fundraising goal all-in for making and promoting the record is about $10k. That’s what I had been thinking and is the number he threw out independently. He said we could do something viable for way less but that given what I intended that number made sense. I’d been worried that he’d say we needed 5 times that amount at which point I’d have to start over in my thinking. 

Getting that ballpark was one of the things I needed from someone who knew. But as you expected he had a lot to say. Advice on some gear I could get that would make doing vocal overdubs at home totally feasible. Broader ideas about trying to get a band across when it doesn’t fit the typical band trajectory. We talked about making your health status public and how it can serve the work you’re making but also some of the downsides of that, too. 

I had such a good feeling that I asked if he would consider participating in the project. He was appropriately circumspect, not having heard the band yet and also—more to the point, I think—being very busy with deadlines for the thing he’s scoring. He also said he was definitely not saying no if there was a way it’d make sense. At a minimum he was clear that he’d be happy to consult about it whenever, make recommendations, vet potential studios, etc. Which is obviously golden.

I sent that practice space recording I’d sent you as well as links to the songs we recorded in the summer. He wrote back to say he’d gotten them but that his son woke up puking yesterday so he hadn’t had a chance to listen. I will be interested to hear his reaction, though. I mean, you never know how stuff will strike someone, and it’s possible he won’t be into it at all. 

All in all just a great meeting. I feel so encouraged recently. Thanks for making the connection.</br></br>

I think they remain real tight though, right? That was the impression I had anyway. Ya know, I’ve exchanged maybe a dozen words with Bobby Donne in my life. One thing that makes that especially odd is that he was in a long-term relationship with Chesley’s identical twin. 


Maude Gonne! That’s it. I think they were the new hot shit for a minute. A long time ago.

Sometimes with famous people you just wonder if there’s nobody around them with the authority to say things like, “That haircut makes you look like Pat Benatar crossed with a Portuguese Water Hound.” And we could do a whole thread about Guitar Face. I think it may be funnier with Metheney because you know he’s not even playing with distortion. That face is powered by pure tone. “Oh. My. God. It’s so… clean.”

So clean, yet so much work required! Ben has the details on Pat M’s signature chorus sound. Several amps onstage and early digital delays between them with varying degrees of modulation. Yada yada! 

Ewan is just hellbent on learning to crawl. This only started like a week ago. But he basically refuses to be on his back anymore. He has to roll over and kind of wriggle in the direction of the toy he’s after. You can tell it frustrates him sometimes. Also he tends to spit up a lot in that mode. It’s tough being a baby. Reach / grasp. He went to two parties this weekend and was charming and chill. That’s about all we could ask for.

Crawling video would be nice!


You know, I feel zero nostalgia for W&M. I liked a lot of people I met there. But it wasn’t better then.

When is your birthday? There’s something silly I want to send you.

Alison is busy being Ms. Producer Lady on two shows they’re prepping, which is her natural habitat. I’m not sure I will ever get over how she just came here and slotted right into the Hollywood machine like she was to the manner born. (I just googled whether it’s “manor.” Apparently the former usage was probably coined by Shakespeare and therefore somewhat more correct, though the latter usage is a pretty good play on the phrase and actually the one I prefer. I leave it to you to choose here.) Being a mom has just opened her up so much, though, like when you put a little water in scotch.

I’d have thought “manor,” too. 

It must be that she had accumulated super relevant skills and the sense of self to use them. It’s pretty amazing. What do you mean by the opening up part—how do you see that? 


Me: I’m told there is movement on the French Foreign Legion thing and the Billie thing. Been hearing that for a year though.

I feel like I”m moving closer to recording some things, just to see if my rough plan is viable. Gonna start with voice. Build songs with that instrument instead of other ones that I’m limited by. See what I get.</br></br>

<b> Feb 5, 2020, at 2:48 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> The complex answer to your t-shirt question is as follows: Of course I want one. But please know that I rarely wear t-shirts with writing / band t-shirts. And I know these things cost dough. So you may decide your resources are better placed elsewhere and instead my TB&TH tramp stamp can be redeemed for free entry to all shows in perpetuity. I will understand. Alison basically never wears t-shirts unless she’s sick. Also: M.

The thing about Bobby Donne that is a surprise to everyone who only knows him by sight is that he doesn’t break your spine and eat your eyeballs, he’s actually super sweet and funny. Mike tells a great story about David Yow being completely intimidated by Bobby, and Bobby in turn feeling intimidated by Yow. Both sweet dudes.

Man, a crawling video WOULD be nice. Alas, one does not exist yet. Because he has not crawled. But will advise.

Your birthday is too far away. I’ll have to just send it for no reason. 

I think the secret to Alison’s success is twofold: A) it wasn’t her life’s dream and so she doesn’t feel like her identity is riding on it; B) her former life as a fine dining waitress afforded lots of free time to sit around with her friends and read great books. She has actual opinions about many great novels, simply because she liked them (or didn’t), and her sense of story comes from that.

Re “opening up” — I just mean that she’s kind of a hardass by nature and Ewan makes all gooey and lovey, and it’s a nice thing to see.</br></br>

I’m ditching Netflix for a spell, got The Criterion Channel. Watched The Friends of Eddie Coyle last night. Man. Those 70s dramas are so grim. Such ugly palettes. And that music—funky bass / wah-wah guitar / clavinet / harmonized woodwinds playing long parallel harmonies. It’s hard to believe that adult Americans once considered all of that entertainment. Unhappy endings! I don’t know why, but I usually find that kind of story reassuring.

David Cossin was the percussionist in question when I was advised not to too strictly notate percussion, let the percussionist roll with it. “Will do.”

I had an interesting moment with Evan Ziporyn. Well, besides learning he’s high school friends with Bernie Wandel, my friend who ran the Black Cat and played in early Rollins Band and who quit smoking after decades and now is a serious yoga guy. Anyway, I’d charted out this piece for BOAC that I wrote using MIDI software, as one does when one can’t read / write music for shit. And in the run through with, uh, most of those players in the video but a different cellist, the cellist complained about one bar that was fucked up. And I was mortified. I thought she meant it like: this is bad. But it turns out I’d written out, like, four quarter notes instead of a whole note, or something, which looks weird to people sight reading. Which, of course, I didn’t know. Evan’s not a real super friendly guy but he sat me down the the score and walked me through it. I was confused because it was technically correct. But he explained the situation. And said he has a lot of students (at MIT I think?) who are in the same boat because they learn music via MIDI notation — which is, weirdly, more like player piano rolls, right? And it’s hard but they have to develop the eyes for sight reading the traditional way. 

One of the moments that really caused me to reconsider my future in that world.</br></br>

<b> Feb 18, 2020, at 1:48 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> This is kind of amazing.

What’s the thing oscillating / tremoloing, same note as that first guitar chord?

At first the string stuff felt to me like it was missing some element but I think it’s a combo of the mix and the particular vibrato of the canned strings. 

Oh man, I was waiting to see how you did that string flourish that happens at 1:45. But clearly you’re not a masochist.</br></br>

<b> Feb 19, 2020, at 6:21 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I hear you about sight reading. Sometimes I wonder how my sight reading ability would map onto to children’s literacy. My guess is that it’s similar to like a first grader. But maybe that’s not the right analogy. I can make sense of a lot of stuff given enough time. It’s the doing it as my eye scans the page that’s impossible. Also, I can write much more difficult things (within my limited range of ability) with relative fluidity compared to my reading of them. The BOAC All-Stars reading that Nancarrow piece is like watching someone turning an apple into gold. It makes no sense to me. It’s like a superpower. To them I guess it’s no more difficult than reading a dense piece of prose?

Every once in a while I have the idea to spend a year working on sight reading for 15 minutes a day. I think the same thing about learning how to play chords on the piano better. But then there’s always the path of least resistance near at hand. It seems like it must be so easy to pick up as a child when you don’t even know you’re learning. Like language.

It’s interesting that the moment with Evan Ziporyn is one of the things that made you reconsider your music future. It feels similar to how I felt at Paterson. But then there’s Arto Lindsay who can’t read or write a single note. I dunno.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> The oscillating thing. I have no idea what that is in the original. I wondered if was a glass armonica? Or maybe a crystal bowl played with a finger? It’s panned hard left. It’s an Eb, the 9th of the root chord.

I think the strings are definitely still missing something. It’s so vexing! Like I said, I keep thinking I’ve gotten it, but when I come back to it it’s still wrong. The mix is a part of that, but not the whole picture.

The thing is, it’s just super fucked up harmonically. That high A is massively discordant with the song’s three chords. It’s almost like they chose an A because it made so little sense with any of the chords. 

If you hear anything I’ve missed, please tell me. It’s like a mirage.

I’m taking it as a cool lesson on drones, I guess. I’m so locked into diatonic harmony (or a handful of stock strategies for getting out of it) that I’d never think of building a cluster of notes like this and just setting it loose under a barely-related chord progression.

Eventually I figure I’ll take a hopeless stab at the middle section. I mean it’s 1000% over my head, but it’s fun to chip away at this stuff.

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Nancarrow
</b> <br><br> This all makes me think of this:

Richmond’s go-to piano repairperson is a Russian named Alex Brusilovsky. You go to his house in the west-end suburbs, and it looks totally banal from the outside. Inside, every room is stuffed full of pianos in various states of repair. I get the feeling they don’t all come from Richmond, like he’s some kind of secret piano fixing savant. There are great big Steinways and Bosendorfers and whatnot everywhere you look, and you kind of follow a goat path through the place. I met him years ago and don’t really remember why. I think maybe I was interested in learning the trade.

After our tour I said something like, “You must be really passionate about the piano to have made this kind of life in it.”

He laughed in my face. He was like, “Passionate?! I’ll tell you about ‘passion.” Then he told me a story of taking an aptitude test when he was like 12. He scored high on “piano tech” and the Soviet system put him on that track pretty much that day. That’d been his work ever since. He actually kind of resented the piano. Was quite a character. Kind of a Russian stereotype. Big, hairy, loud, dark view of everything.

I guess it’s for the good that we don’t track young people like that. BUT I can’t help imagining that in a culture that valued the arts more than ours does, kids like you would’ve been nurtured in your musical interest, and not necessarily by parents, but by a school system and broader cultural environment that recognized your level of interest and aptitude as being of value to society. I definitely don’t mean this in a crying-over-spilled-milk way. It’s just that I wonder. Because I’ve lived in the U.S. my whole life, where living as a professional artist is viewed as self-indulgent and luxurious, I’ve absorbed a lot of that crap. I dunno. Maybe it’s the same everywhere.

In any case, I cannot for the life of me imagine getting “expensive conservatory schooling” in my late 30s! Yuuuuuuck.

I wonder about my own trajectory, too. They wanted me to come back to Paterson. I never could figure out why. I was NEVER gonna be able to play jazz in the way that people do. I wonder what they saw / heard that I didn’t, Sometimes it just seems like “people who know” don’t care all that much what you can / can’t do when they encounter you. Like they respond to your curiosity or ability to articulate a point of view or your obstinate opinion that won’t back down when disagreed with.

One time I did some career counseling that involved assessing my pitch discrimination among 500 other things. The woman asked if I was a musician. I said sometimes. She said—like as an aside—usually people with pitch discrimination like that who are musicians feel a lot of anxiety if they don’t make music regularly. My goal now is just to not stop again.</br></br>

<b> Feb 19, 2020, at 1:23 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> 100% certain those BOAC people have rehearsed that piece. Still, I bet they got pretty close on the first run-through. 

I told you that thing right about how I gave Michael Gordon my iPod with math rock cued up? He didn’t care for Sliang Laos. But he loved the shit out of Breadwinner.

I had been trying to explain to him my path from simple musics to more complex musics, and how RVA math rock was kind of my jazz. It opened a door. The whole room of people laughed aloud at the term “math rock.” I think they were laughing with me, not at me.

The thing with Evan Ziporyn didn’t break me but it was one of those peek-behind-the-curtain moments that add up eventually. Where you start to realize how much you don’t know, and start to weigh what it would take to get there. I feel certain that, had I chosen to die on that hill, I could have done good work and made a life. But the doors weren’t really opening for me in the way I’d hoped and the magnitude of sacrifice to reach that place seemed too great. With no guarantee of a payoff.

Really, what it meant was that I probably couldn’t have taken any of the available pathways in “classical” music. But maybe I could have made a life out of doing avant garde things that drew from that but didn’t rest squarely inside it. Like Arto Lindsay, or that guy Bryce from The National who plays with BOAC, or more likely I’d have veered toward music theater things rather than strict opera / chamber music. But I was 35 when I made the decision. A lot of water under the bridge already.

Last Sunday while reading the Times I held up a composer profile to Alison and said: This was the woman who basically caused me to quit pursuing new classical stuff. At a composer residency thing Tania Leon made me get up and conduct my own piece. I had never held a baton before. It was literally the feeling of being in front of the class with no pants on. Eventually she took mercy on me and did it herself. But that was the piece where my friend, who was highly trained, said that there were good parts to it but they could see the parts where I’d faked it. I didn’t realize it was that transparent. But now that I write screenplays, I can see INSTANTLY — like on the first page — whether a script is good or bad. And if someone doesn’t know what they’re doing in some aspect it’s instantly visible. So now I get it. So barring a lot of expensive conservatory schooling in my late 30s, I think I made the right decision.</br></br>

It just amused me to ponder for a moment since one of her most amazing utterances when we were dating was “I hate white people!” I just had the thought that she’s inevitably living in Trump country somewhere and being conventional and spending her parents’ money.

Sometimes I second guess one of my utterances at random, just to keep in practice.

You are a musical legend!

SO EMBARRASSING. The damage was done before I could complain. 


Sincerely though, this music is great stuff. I like that doing an assignment frees you up to do things you might not otherwise. Fun.

Yeah. “Creepy Disney” is what Greg ended up calling this, which is definitely not my thing but was a blast to think through. Kinda hoping Susann’s agent might want more of these things. I think I could handle scoring more one-minute videos. Not one second longer, though.


I had the thought that if I could get all the emails in one document we should publish them in some pompous multi-volume set, like The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, or something. It would actually be super easy. I just made a book for Ewan with Shutterfly. Cost $30.

The Collected Correspondence of Bob & Tim Volumes I-III: 1996-2020. Bound in kid leather with gilt accents. I’d love to have some version of that.


I think the grant thing is a great idea! They have to give away that money. Might as well be to you. That’s awesome.

It’s due a week from today, so it’ll hafta go real fast. I’ll just kinda wing it and send it off.</br></br>

Plan C is to punt and just print the PDF files as is. 

The fucked up thing is that if I do all this from my online Gmail account, there are scripts that take out the quotes and shit. But you can't reorder them chronologically. However if I do this from my Mac Mail app, I can reorder them chronlogically but can't strip out the quote levels.

<b>  February 28, 2020 at 6:58:04 AM PST
 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Natalie and Jacob come over on Thursdays for dinner and a movie. We must be approaching our 100th film by now. We have a list, but it needs updating.

Usually we each pick a movie then flip for the winner. But last night I wanted to watch Contagion with them. I’ve been amazed by their near-complete lack of interest in the goings-on of the world. I mean, they’re both under 20, so the only reason I’m surprised is that I’ve forgotten how little I cared about the news at that age. 

I had a sit-down talk to assess what they’d heard about Covid-19. They hadn’t heard much and had the overall sense that it was no big deal. I didn’t want them to panic, but I wanted to impress its seriousness on them and tell them what evidence suggests they can actively do to avoid being infected. I also wanted to suggest how they might avoid giving any leeway to the conspiracy nonsense that’s floating around. My basic message: It’s serious, it’s likely to affect all our lives, we only have four people left in our entire family, here’s your best bet for staying safe. Then I talked about getting the fuck away from people who are sneezing and coughing in public, and how to effectively wash your hands.

Jacob seemed to take it in. Natalie, who is in a very defensive moment in life, all but rolled her eyes. Then we watched the movie. I’d seen it when it came out, but watching it this time was truly eery. The pandemic it imagines is faster-spreading and much deadlier than this Coronavirus, but a lot of that movie feels like a documentary of the present moment, right down to dudes in hazmat suits disinfecting the streets in China.

When it was over, Natalie was no more concerned than she had been. I felt like every elder in history must’ve felt when trying to warn the young of a serious danger to which they thought themselves immune. As an uncle, I have a certain distance, an ability to stand back and say, “Oh well. I’ve done what I can. It’s up to them now.”

But if I were her parent, I I think I would’ve started yelling.</br></br>

She wrote back quoting the current CDC guidelines—patients should have enough meds to cover any potential two week shortfall.

I’ve been keeping up with the more academic side of the discussion for about a month. I feel like I have a fairly accurate sense of the range of possibilities. But it remains a wide range. 

One data point that seems hopeful is that it's is sparing the young. I’m primarily concerned about Natalie and Jacob losing me or their dad.

I am feeling waves of real fear. Am gonna interrupt the regularly scheduled program of therapy tomorrow to try to figure out what to do about that.</br></br>

We’re good. Alison’s mom’s weekend babysit was an experiment — can we go away and leave the kid with her without any freakouts? All went well. We only went out to the desert, so within a drive back if something went wrong, but everyone was fine. You were mentioned while we were out there because we went to our favorite restaurant, called La Copine, which is out in the middle of literal nowhere in the desert near Joshua Tree. This place is so unlikely. I may have mentioned it before but it’s these two women who are a couple. They just bought this defunct restaurant out in the middle of the scrub but now in the era of social media it’s ALWAYS full. And they’re open from like 2-7pm. They basically just decided that’s when they want to work. And the food is just astonishing. I had this fantasy of driving you out there without saying where we were going so I could see the look on your face when you got to this joint and took the first bite. 

I’m a pretty big fan of rotisserie chicken. Yummm.

Man, dude. That is deep. I’ve had thoughts like that, more thinking about sex and what it is we men are going for when we relentlessly pursue new sexual objects. Like what’s the thing behind the thing? I’ve long thought, like: well, we’re reaching for God, right? I mean, if you could have sex with every single woman in the world, you still wouldn’t be satisfied. So it has to be something besides any particular woman. 

And I’ve been willing to give myself away for it as though my self had no value.

I just returned from my haircut. First time with this hair person. Turns out I’d met her at a recent volunteer thing. Obviously, it’s gross to talk about what women look like, so I’ll try to keep that to a minimum. But she is beautiful in the way of the most beautiful movie starts. Like it almost feels like you’ve been punched in the gut. And she’s single, which she mentioned in the first five minutes. And came back to repeatedly.

Then, walking home, I found myself saying, “Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!” Because at long last I’m free from my wounded narcissist’s fascination with physically beautiful women. The freedom has been taking shape for maybe two years. My response to women’s beauty has always been so confusing. It’s never really been sexual possession I craved. And at least consciously it wasn’t that I wanted beauty at hand to reflect something about myself. Eventually, in therapy, all I could say was that when I encountered beauty like the hairstylist’s, I wanted to possess the beauty itself. It has always been a weird, keening ache. And I’ve been willing to give myself away for it as though my self had no value.

Finally, the ache is gone! It is a genuinely blessed state.</br></br>

As much as I love that whole record, Johnny Mathis’s Feet is the song that slays me the most as far as the lyrics go. I’ve been going back to it on-and-off for years. So sad, so knowing, so hilarious. I think it’s one of the main touch points for how I think of Timothy Bailey as a character. He’s meant to be both of these dudes! 

That last verse. Damn.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I guess I feel like the yearning for connection / for love / for a sense of completion has to be a search for God. 

But I don’t know what the exaggerated reaction to physical beauty is. Maybe partially something about God, about transcendence? 

On the other hand, maybe it’s predatory. Maybe it’s the opposite of love? 

Whatever it is, I’m always surprised how much it varies. Have you ever noticed that? How some people care a lot what other people look like, while others really seem not to care at all? I tend to like the people in the latter category more which I guess says something.

I have bad enough chest congestion that I didn’t drive to DC today. No fever. A little bit of a cough in the morning, but it goes away once I’m up and about. Under normal circumstances I’d have noticed it and considered it a nuisance. It’s paranoia-inducing now, though. Obviously the statistical likelihood is that it’s a regular old cold.

That article by the psychopath was so interesting. It’s fascinating how the nature / nurture dichotomy seems to be falling apart under closer scrutiny. One thing I took from that piece was that the guy’s training as a scientist (not just in terms of reading scans, but in terms of his rigorous thinking) was what allowed him to see himself. It’s almost the main feature of personality pathology that the sufferer cannot perceive his own situation. I was fascinated that his family members appreciated how he tried to be better even though he thought his phoned-in efforts were baloney.

I’m so glad I’m not a psychopath. It could’ve been otherwise.</br></br>

<b> Mar 10, 2020, at 1:19 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I haven’t heard what’s up with Alison’s mom. We should find out. 

Alison and the baby have a mild congestion thing going on too. Nothing harsh. Ewan is as happy as ever. But he stayed home from daycare today. Like you, we surf the statistics and feel it’s probably just a cold. But we’re gonna call the doc just to find out what to look for, where’s the line that would necessitate a visit. 

How’re Alison and Ewan now? 

My dumb congestion is clearing up.


Also thus far we haven’t cancelled our May Italy tickets. Just waiting to see what happens a bit longer. Might be that Italy gets cleared before other places since it got hit first. Dunno. There’s time to decide.

Shit’s getting real over here. My friend who runs Visarts had to cancel a conference they and VCU were doing that had 6000 people coming. Valley had a big conference this weekend that just got cancelled. VCU is adding another week to spring break, but my guess is they won’t reopen the campuses in two weeks. First case has appeared in central Virginia. 

We just cancelled our show which was supposed to take place a week from today. Felt super wrong to invite people to that. The good news is we’re gonna try to put on a Facebook Live event with decent sound and whatnot.


In that article, the guy’s vascillation between gimlet-eyed self-analysis and defensiveness was really something. I wish I could witness the conversation instead of reading about it. I thought it was fascinating that he knew he behaved badly a lot but was so surprised when people reminded him they said he was exhibiting dubious behavior. I started to wonder if there’s such a thing as a “good” psychopath, as opposed to the popular conception, whose condition is skewed toward something positive. I mean, maybe that’s this guy, but I can’t tell how it affects his scientific work, if at all. But it must, right?


I bet psychopaths are great peer reviewers. I bet that in general they’re great at the parts of conducting science that rely on cold-eyed skepticism. I’d guess that at least in the social sciences they suck at generating hypotheses. 


I’m on the verge of getting paid for the first time in over a year, so I bought some wireless noise-cancelling headphones. I am really really into the idea of these things. Especially for use on airplanes. Though mostly I’ll use them to watch TV after baby bedtime. I haven’t yet looked up how noise-cancelling tech works but I’d imagine it’s something like phase cancellation. Years ago I got my mind a little blown by learning how to take a recording, make a L-R mirror image of it, and use the phase cancelling to isolate or remove the vocals. So cool. Science!


Hope you got your $$$!!!!!

The real factor that may cause us to cancel Italy is that we were going to NYC the week before for TV Upfronts (which are about selling advertising to sponsors, so they’re big flashy convention type things) and those dominos are toppling. So we’d have to rebook our first Italy flight anyway. We just discussed cancelling the whole deal and — since we’d likely get a better deal now anyway — rebooking it if things in Italy are better. We did notice that things are reopening in China. 

The real irony here is that I’m less worried about the actual virus and now more concerned about the panic / supply chain breakdown. 

Everything in Hollywood is getting cancelled. Everyone’s working from home. They cancelled SXSW, which fucked a bunch of movie premieres (including my friend Scott Teems’ new movie) and Austin is gonna lose $300M. But it’s kinda weird, no one seems panicked when I go out to get coffee or whatever. I read that Singapore and Hong Kong took heavy quarantine and testing measures immediately and thus their infection rate is low. So maybe this will work out here, dunno.

I bought this great kalimba in Buenos Aires and I love it. The keys are in this unusual configuration. But when the temperature in the house changes it tends to make little pings and pops. Angus HATES THAT. It freaks him out. He gets paranoid, like something’s sneaking up on him in the jungle. So now he came into the office to escape the ravenous kalimba.</br></br>

Re the pilot — I’m writing it alone. I’ve written two versions of this before but I hated both of them. They were too influenced by bad producer notes. I know better now. This is completely rethought on the character level. It’s not trying to be something it shouldn’t be (a la a modern THE DIRTY DOZEN). The time frame is technically 10 weeks for the first draft, 6 weeks for a final draft, 6 weeks for a rewrite, and 4 weeks for a polish. An absurdly long time, by my standards, though I’m glad some writers are happy to have it. It’s already outlined in a fair bit of detail so I’m gonna pound through it ASAP — mainly because you get paid at each step. And these fuckos have taken a year to close my deal. So they’re gonna get a so-so first draft from me so that I can get that dough. I’ll do the heavy lifting on the next pass.</br></br>

I got tested for virus yesterday. Results several days away. Feel no worse today, so that’s good. 

Thinking about you guys.</br></br>

<b> Mar 22, 2020, at 1:21 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I was saying to someone that in certain ways my routine is unchanged. I stand at the desk and write much of the day. I'm lucky to have this work to do. Alison's two shows pushed production but she's working on their other stuff in development, so she's here on phone calls and reading and giving notes. We took Ewan out of daycare so we're sorting how to split shifts watching him and working. That's tricky and pretty exhausting. He's largely fun but he requires constant focus. And we both have real shit we have to do. Also, it's been raining here, which kinda kills the mood. But I think that's coming to an end. 

I take the dog for long walks, and now I'm assembling a list of everywhere in the neighborhood that does take-out. Both for our sanity and to help them stay afloat. Yesterday we went on a long hike in Griffith Park. Tons of other people out doing the same. Everyone keeping their distance but basically upbeat. You could see the ocean from the top of the hike, which is not usually the case. The air is so clear from the lack of traffic. 

The industry is gonna take a massive hit. But I have to say, I have a hard time weeping for rich people. I just know that it rolls downhill to all the below-the-line workers and to a lot of people like me. 

Also, a week into this, my native introversion is coming out more as I burn through my proximity reserves. I'm starting to tell Alison that I need "introvert time." 

One thing I have noticed: dogs don't give a flying shit about our quarantine. Dogs are like: fuck you, you will walk me bitch. And I will wag my tail like the happy guy I am.

</br></br>

<b> Mar 23, 2020, at 3:18 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I hear you about native introversion. My sense is that it’s gonna be paying attention to that kind of thing that’ll make it survivable over the long haul. Probably true in all human interaction but just so intensified in crisis and close proximity. For me that’s probably the case, like reading signs early and responding. 

I kinda have the opposite problem right now. One of the ways I stay sane is by having social stuff to look forward to at the end of the day when other people’s lives chill. I can have a real rough day mentally then rise to the occasion because of friends’ presence. Trying to figure that out some with FaceTime and zoom. 

My test results are delayed. The doctor called to tell me. She’s advising patients that even if it’s negative they should remain completely isolated for several weeks.  She said she doubts the accuracy of the commercial tests. Cough better, but am short of breath if I exert myself. Not a crisis. Just real spooky I guess. 

Today my friend Stan dropped off a mountain of groceries. I hadn’t planned for potentially having this thing, so I didn’t have enough stuff. Now I do. I put in the order and Kroger brought it out to Stan’s car. Tonight I’m gonna binge so fucking hard on those little Hostess powdered donuts!

Looking forward to talking with you and Chad tomorrow.</br></br>

It helped a little, but mostly just sounded like a reverberant morass. I made the big descending part a whole tone scale in 32nd note triplets…have no idea if that’s what happens in the original. I think one of the major differences is that the run is heavily slurred on the original while that articulation doesn’t exist in Logic.

Apparently, false negatives are a big problem with the commercial test, which skipped most of the normal reviews.

</b> <br><br> I ended up sticking the original in Logic and slowing it way down. It helped a little, but mostly just sounded like a reverberant morass. I made the big descending part a whole tone scale in 32nd note triplets…have no idea if that’s what happens in the original. I think one of the major differences is that the run is heavily slurred on the original while that articulation doesn’t exist in Logic.

Wally Stott and Peter Knight are the names I’m finding as orchestrators of the early stuff. I’m sure I read an interview with one of them, I feel like it was Wally Stott, who was dismissive about the whole thing but did a lot of that crazy stuff as requested.

In fact this confirms my recollection because I knew Wally Stott had changed genders and gotten a new name. 
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/angela-morley-composer-and-arranger-who-worked-with-scott-walker-and-scored-dynasty-and-dallas-1488590.html 
"Stott was involved in rock'n'roll, too, arranging Marty Wilde's album, Wilde About Marty (1959), as well as several of his hits. He arranged Dusty Springfield's "All I See Is You" (1966) and several of Scott Walker's interpretations of Jacques Brel's deeply troubled chansons, including "Jacky" (1967). Stott arranged Walker's 1969 album, Scott 3. Walker commented that "Working with Wally Stott on Scott 3 was like having Delius writing for you.””</br></br>

Wally Stott is the person I’d read about. It’s helpful to have that tidbit that it was Stott who did Scott 3, specifically—I hadn’t seen that before. To me the orchestrations on 3 are especially interesting.

I wonder if the studio kept scores. I guess if there was ever a time to email people about this kind of thing, it’d be now.

Hello David,

My name is Tim McCready. I am a musician in Richmond, Virginia. I was referred to you by Christine Parker. I have been trying to track down any original Angela Morley scores from the recording sessions of Scott Walker's first three solo records.

I'd be so grateful for any information you could share. My interest is purely personal—not commercial. I've been trying to transcribe bits and pieces, and would just love to see the scores.

I hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe in the midst of this strange and frightening time.

Scott was known to have said of Angela :'it's like having Delius write for you' and this was indeed some of her most imaginative work. Christine

I apologize for the delayed response. My computer was down for a couple of days, and I wanted to double-check my database of Angela’s archive. But indeed none of the Scott Walker scores are there. Christine and I both recall Angela mentioning that she often left scores on the podium after recording sessions—something she came to regret in her later years.

I know how validating it is to be able to verify our by-ear transcriptions by seeing the actual scores. This is a case where that probably will not be possible, unfortunately.

A while ago I asked Chris Farmer if he’d send me some iPhone voice memos of his playing some odd time beats. Thought I’d see if I could make loops out ‘em. The audio fidelity is meh, but here’s the first one I made. You should be able to drag it into Logic with the time signature set at 5/4.




Then I got sidetracked and spent a lot of the day dicking around making this:





I’m gonna take a walk tomorrow. Haven’t left the apartment or the immediate downstairs since 3/14. Gonna wake up early and go.

How are you guys doing?</br></br>

<b> Apr 11, 2020, at 7:10 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Haven't listened to the raw drum loop file yet but I LOVE that thing you made. You should have a whole separate identity for stuff like that. 

MAN Chris Farmer's playing is just so buttery.

How did the walk go? Did you commemorate it in some way? A proclamation, perhaps, or a clarion call? 

We took Mr. Dog and Mr. Baby up to the snow today. So fun. Mr. Baby was a little indifferent and refused to play along with our sentimentalizing of the occasion. First snow! He didn't care. Mr. Dog, on the other hand, freaked the fuck out, as he always does. My favorite move is when he just plops belly down in the snow and rolls his face all in it. Like it's money he just stole from a bank. It's fun driving up there because Mr. Dog knows something's afoot and he gets wired and restless like a little kid, are we there yet? 

I'm enjoying my third bout of cellulitis in like two years. No real idea why. I have an infection on my right shoulder blade. The doctor said that my records indicate I'm a carrier for staph, but 30% of people are. I'm on two kinds of antibiotics. Which really taxes me, as evening beverages is getting me through this quarantine. Well, was. And all our favorite restaurants and bars now deliver wine and whatever. One place delivered a tasty jar of skinny margaritas. Anyway, mostly it's just uncomfortable. It cycles through stretches where I feel feverish, though I'm not, and then I sweat it out and I'm fine again. 

Ewan is sitting up now and just started "solid" food. He is fucking INTO it.

You ever seen the UK panel show “Would I Lie to You?” In season 12 episode 10 (a little over 11 minutes in), David Mitchell goes on an astonishing rant about the effect on excrement of a baby’s transition from liquid to solid food. I saw it the other night and nearly passed out from laughing. Is this something you’ve noted?

Thanks about the Chris Farmer thing. Here’s another one from the same loop:



<Chris Farmer in 5 Number 2.mp3>

 

Your story about Angus in the snow reminded me of Neko Case’s dogs. Do you follow her on Instagram? Sometimes there is high quality animal content. It sounds nice to have gone out into the natural world like that.

My walk was just…sad. I hate to say it. But I hadn’t been out of my apartment (or immediately behind it) for about a month, and whereas that time felt like the world as a hurricane approaches, this time felt like a world in a zombie movie. Yesterday, though, I went and sat in a friend’s back yard, and that was real nice.

How is your work going? How is Alison doing?

</b> <br><br> They’re all Logic instruments. I guess I think the “studio strings” and “studio horns” are all pretty good like in the middle of a sustained note. The problem with the strings is always the attack and release sound so stark. I’ve been trying to figure out how to make ‘em sound more natural by adjusting the volume on a per-note basis. (If you really dig in there’s a way to draw curves into each note’s data—not just in mixing.) That and some reverb begin to make them sound credible for harmonic stuff, I think. Unless I’m totally fooling myself.

I wanted the horns on this one to sound like Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry. So it’s one of the alto saxes. I added a little distortion. Then I fucked with the intonation of individual notes, making ‘em ever so flat here and there. Lots of the (shitty) Apple reverb. I wanted the trumpet to sound pretty weird. So I added some modulation stuff. I have NO IDEA how this stuff is supposed to be done, but it’s fun to try.

I played the horn parts in on guitar. I have a plugin that turns guitar audio into MIDI. It only works but so well, so I don’t grab it that much. The bass is a Logic instrument called “studio upright bass” with a little overdrive and some eq stuff. The guitar part is just me playing into Logic with a patch called “New Wave Chorus” or something. The clav part is a patch called "auto wah clav". I didn’t do anything to it.

David Mitchell. I’m so glad that clip got to you. Man, it was one of those moments for me where I’m like…is this how I die? Laughing at David Mitchell “ranking the excrements?”

Oh, hey, I’m making progress on the middle section of “It’s Raining Today.”

I watched that clip of DM and died. I sent it to Alison. Though I’m not sure she knows who he is.

I do follow Neko Case. I love how much shit she talks about her dogs. 

I think next time your walk should including something publicly absurd. Like riding your Segway the wrong way down the middle of a major road while blasting Moondog, or something.

The very idea of making HORNS sound legit in Logic just boggles my mind. I've heard so many bad fake horns. I mean, you can hide a lot if it's a horn section but to do actual individual lines. Man. Hell of a job there.

Work is going pretty well here. I just finished (I think) a beat sheet for the pilot script I'm writing. Sent it to my producer Kirstin to look over while I wait for the big producer's check to hit my account. As you'll recall, the deal took over a year. My manager has been assured that the money guys have my info and the money is on the way but I'm not sending the company my work until I get it. They seem like okay people, despite the wait, but fuck that.

It's finally sunny here after a lot of rain so everything is feeling pretty up.

Opening the pool sounds like a grand affair! It’ll be cute to see Ewan in the pool. At this point what does Angus make of Ewan? What does Ewan make of Angus? A friend of mine had a kid right around when Ewan was born, and it’s really interesting to watch him interact with the many dogs in his life. I’m not sure he draws a distinction between human “others” and canine others.

I’ll tell ya, listening to Infinite Jest gives me all kinds of big reactions. One has to do with the time that we came of age as creative people. It may have been an especially arid time intellectually. If I didn’t know how massive a heart DFW had for people, I wouldn’t have kept listening as long as I have. The tone is so clinical. I’m only 1/7 of the way through it—that’s a little over 8 hours of audio. The reader is Sean Pratt. He’s okay. He reads women’s dialogue weirdly. Audible includes the footnotes in a pdf.

The other big feeling I have is that it’s gonna resolve into a story (at least in part) about family trauma and probably incest. At least implied. I just got through James Incandenza Sr’s big drunk soliloquy. It goes on forever and sounds EXACTLY like how a certain kind of rueful alcoholic goes on forever about his woes. But I’m hooked.</br></br>

Whoa that's an interesting idea. Who reads that? There's a cocktail bar in the neighborhood called ETA, for Enfield Tennis Academy. I haven't read it in ages but I remember loving it when I did. I would totally read that again. Except that I stalled out on The Pale King so I feel like I should maybe get through that. I think it's the only piece of DFW stuff I haven't finished.

We're having our first legit hot day of the year. After a lot of gloomy days and rain. Thinking about opening the pool for the season. 

I read this really fascinating book about the making of CHINATOWN. It's called The Big Goodbye. I don't know how such a thing would read to non-industry people but it was a pretty fascinating slice of the era, not so unlike that last Tarantino movie. Funny thing is, Robert Towne, who wrote CHINATOWN and is ostensibly the hero of the book, comes off looking like a pretty sizeable dick. The only one who comes off in a good light is Jack Nicholson, who is apparently super loyal and will do anything for a friend. Wouldn't have expected that. Although he's banging floozies three at a time even while he's dating Angelica Huston. So that's a minus.

This was one of the earliest shows I ever played in a band. I remember being intimidated that Flat Stanley was headlining because I'd seen them open for The Good Guys at Going Bananas in Shockoe Slip, which was my first-ever club show. I wasn't intimidated by The Xntrix because of course, come on. But also I'd met most of them already. If I'm not misremembering, Noal's dad came and drunkenly wandered onto the stage while we were playing. Noal was PISSED. I thought he might throw down with his old man right there.</br></br>

<b> Apr 29, 2020, at 8:23 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> That Gino Vanelli is just the worst. The very worst. But man, I swear, the young folks call back to that stuff like 1,000 times to 1 when compared to, say, anything punk or post punk. It was fascinating over the past year or so to go out and hear these bands of people in their 20s and early 30s who were aiming directly at smoothness. I think punk is to a lot of millennials what skiffle was to us: irrelevant and hokey. Here’s my theory: They were raised on singing competitions like American Idol. They value singers “who can SING” and smooth jams that feel pleasant. I’m not saying dudes like Thundercat don’t have a way wider scope than that. But it does seem like there’s a generation of younger musicians who are explicitly aiming for Toto and who think that The Clash were wankers who sucked because they didn't sing in tune or play perfectly in the pocket.</br></br>

I bet Topsy Turvy featured exactly the waves I’m talking about. I love that stuff. Theatrical illusion or whatever. 

Again, I’m starstruck that you had a zoom call with Amy Adams. I like to think I don’t t give much of a shit about celebrity, but when it comes right down to it, I am amazed that a friend of mine has interacted professionally with Amy Adams. I don’t know why that is.

Nostalgia: When I cleared the last of my stuff out of Chesley’s house post divorce I took it straight to the dump. I have very few crystal clear regrets, but that’s one of them. I kept my letters from Ryan, but pitched all the other ephemera associated with my life. It seems like there’s something evil waiting in nostalgia’s wings and something free that comes from avoiding it. But I wish I’d kept that stuff and made a decision about it in a calmer moment.

I guess I’m holding up generally okay. It’s like I’ve been training for this my whole life, but there are two things that cause me immediate problems. The first is (duh) social interaction. I spend like 95% of life alone, and I count on two or three dinners / coffee / walks per week to give some semblance of structure to life. I gnaw on those moments like bones. But Zoom and the occasional masked walk through the alleys make up for some of the absence.

The thing that fills me with dread is the loss of band practice. Apart from therapy and meds, the two things that have kept me stable for the last several years have been writing with Valley’s group and working with the band. Weekly practice gave my life a shape. It gave me tasks to accomplish before the next week. It was a way of being with people that was focused on a common goal, like a job. It took me too long to realize how much I needed that in order to be well, and its absence frankly hurts. Being alone in my apartment in a sea of undifferentiated time almost makes the entire experience of the past two years of music feel like a mirage. I can feel myself slipping towards quitting. I can see why I’ve quit in the past. It’s like the part of me who is creative just disappears or whatever. But this time around I can see my old tricks, and I’m not gonna let ‘em win.</br></br>

<b> Apr 29, 2020, at 4:44 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I do wonder about all this. I can’t tell at all. I kinda thought it started ironically, with Yacht Rock stuff, but then maybe segued into people really getting into that stuff. I mean, as a type of music it does have a certain narcotic effect. That's what it's engineered to do. Maybe this is possible *because* it's built on a history that includes punk rock etc.? So kids are like: Yeah yeah punk rock's an option but also this, and this makes me feel all gooey. I think about all the neighborhood hipsters who look like they just arrived from Margaritaville -- I mean, willfully dressed for maximum Mom Jeans ugly -- and I think there's some knowingness involved. I certainly don't find a high degree of musical acumen to be any kind of presence in pop that's cool now. It tends to be underbaked and often pretty derivative, to my ear.  Who's the Michael Jackson, or even the Mariah Carey? Billie Eilish? I don't think so, though she's got more chops than most. Tame Impala? That guy writes songs that are one riff, no chorus. There is no current young group that approximates Toto, I don't think. I dunno. Maybe because anything not hip hop is kind of niche music now?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I dunno. Do you remember encountering people from the Pacific Northwest during the 90s? Like how they didn’t relate to irony? Were almost goofily sincere? Not talking about grunge scene types. Just normal people from up there. That’s how the millennial musicians I see and hear around Richmond seem. They always begin their sets by saying, “Hey guys,” the way they also begin all their YouTube videos. Feels like you’re at a sock hop or something. No edge. Edge is eschewed, even. And the callbacks to the 80s are more sitcom-based than music-based, Golden Girls, Family Ties. Tender, earnest, devoid of irony. Also, they’ve run their smoothness fetish through their deep, deep appreciation of Death Cab for Cutie. 

None of the guitarists EVER use distortion!

The irony-free sincerity of it…the earnestness…is very sweet.

And it’s perfectly designed to alienate me.

Except, then, there’s this subset of them who have really responded to TB&TH, so go figure.

Their kids are gonna reinvent punk. I bet it starts in 2030. And it’s gonna be real rough and tumble!</br></br>

<b> May 11, 2020, at 11:15 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Now what’s happening there?

Here: Not much change. Trying to get reoriented to an earlier-to-bed, earlier-to-rise schedule because I feel better in the early AM / get more creative work done then.

I moved furniture around in my bedroom. Then my living room. It makes a surprisingly refreshing difference.

The band is doing a demo thing a part at a time. I wrote the strings for string quartet which was fun.

Am fooling around trying to learn some Piazzolla etudes. They’re hard. Lots of quintuplets and shit.

Talked with Jason Cadell today.

I dunno. That’s about it.

Hello to the lady, the boy, and the dog.</br></br>

<b> May 12, 2020, at 3:55 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> What would you say is the worst emoji of all the emojis? I guess I don’t really know all the emojis but I think the one I hate most, having encountered it in the wild, is 

I’m a big believer in rearranging furniture. We did that once the baby came, out of necessity, and it was actually great. We’d previously thought we’d found the one true platonic arrangement of our furniture. But now we like the new arrangement better. Feels like a new-ish place.

I like Piazzolla a lot. I don’t think I’ll learn any etudes.

What’s Caddell up to? It’s been a while since I’ve talked to him. Love that guy.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> What is it you hate so much about that emoji? I’m so curious! I do not object to that one, especially. On the whole, I think I basically like emojis as tone modifiers in texts.

Jason: They bought a house in Westover Hills. He has lots of woodworking questions that make me feel useful.

I finished Infinite Jest. Lots of reactions. One of which is kind of: 🤷🏻‍♂️ Seems like something I’ll be thinking about for a while. It was a long, concentrated experience. I’m not sad that it’s over.</br></br>

Why do our minds do that to us?!

<b> May 18, 2020, at 9:37 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I have periods of really amazing dreams. But for some reason lately it’s been locked in cycles of “process.” Me trying to accomplish something, over and over, all night. It’s boring, if nothing else. I guess my job is kind of like that, so maybe that’s it? 

I think you’ve mentioned that gig but I would welcome more detail. 

It’s raining today.</br></br>

<b> May 18, 2020, at 10:53 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Last night I had a dream that you were in. It started out as helping some producer guy, who seemed well known but I don’t know his name, clean up his studio. But that turned into forming a band with him, but you were in it, and I think maybe this other guy who plays with Bob Mould. But of course my guitar strings hadn’t been changed in maybe years, so I had to change them. And then I never got around to tuning them because I was disentangling all the power cords for my pedals. And deciding which pedals I needed. Some had bateries so old they’d crumbled. But I got you guys to start playing about an hour in , while I was still getting it together. And of course I hadn’t rehearsed and didn’t know any of the songs. It was one of those dreams where the process is endless and takes up the whole night of sleep, seemingly, so it’s not fun or restful. You sounded good though.</br></br>

My friend Sarah ran that Gofundme on my behalf. She had not received a notification, but the money is there. Thank you so much, Bob. Geez. This makes a huge difference to me.</br></br>

I watched a movie Tessa Lane was in ("Sorry to Bother You”) Sunday night in a friend’s back yard and was sad about the Billie project. I hope something great still comes out of it. 

I’d written a song for that I was gonna throw your way at some point. In my fantasy I dreamed of it being sung by someone playing BH. Was too embarrassed to even mention, but I dunno. Why not. It may be very bad. It’s definitely of that era. The hook is based on this thing Cordelia says to King Lear after her sisters have been flattering him. She basically says, “My love for you is nothing,” as in, like no-thing. “My love for you is nothing” seemed like something Billie Holliday may be able to get across.

Fuck. Man. I’ve had a rough 24 hours. Fuzzy’s sick. It’s been scary, but the upshot is that he’s probably going to be okay. He has an inflamed pancreas, but they don’t know why. Got IV stuff put in him today, x-rays didn’t show anything. If he’s not significantly improved tomorrow I’ll take him back and they’ll do an ultrasound. Last night he was in a lot of pain. It was awful. We went to the emergency vet for an evaluation. They said he’d be okay until seeing the regular vet today. Tonight he’s nowhere near as bad off as last night, but he’s not himself either. I keep reminding myself that they really think he’s gonna be fine.

It’s hard to think of what else is up.

Oh, I’ve committed myself to creating a 30-35 live music entertainment via livestream that avoids all the boring stuff about people playing acoustic guitars in front of a computer in their living rooms. I’m gonna use a combination of QLab, MainStage, multiple cameras, and green screen stuff along with some kind of narrative thread, props, etc. etc. I think there’ll be a printed program that goes out in the mail a week before the thing. Might raid attendees’ Instagram accounts for material to be used during the thing. Or maybe there’ll be a sing along component. Not sure. Working on it a lot. Basically last week I realized I wasn’t gonna be able to coast on the good feelings from The Humans. Hopefully we all get back to that sooner rather than later, but I need to do something productive now.

It’ll be called Various Longing. Here’s a real rough (no vocal yet) draft of the first song from it, "Isaiah.”</br></br>

<b> May 26, 2020, at 8:14 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> First day back to daycare for E. Thomas Baby. Six hours of unbroken bliss (i.e. work). 

I just turned in my first draft for this Legion show. I think it’s pretty hot. But you never know how execs will react. Awaiting a time to get on a zoom with them.

Also spent part of the day revising the Seattle pilot for Ms. Amy Adams. (Actually, for her exec.) 

Just got off the zoom with the producers on the Billie project. Trying to salvage this thing. I read the Lee Daniels script. This isn’t professional jealousy: it’s not good. And that seems to be the consensus about the actual film, which has no distribution at this point. Not sure how that’ll affect us. But they have asked me to take some big swings and reimagine the thing. (Le sigh.) I’m now really and truly trying to think of a way to lean into our strongest asset, which is the music. Not make it a musical but do something. There are some scenes of magical realism in my pilot outline so I may run with that. Tell it more from inside Billie’s head. Or from some God POV or something. And refract it, make it cubist somehow. I don’t know. I may be fucked. But they owe me $20k and this is how I have to get it. What would Donald Glover do? What would Borges do? What would what would what would

What doing?</br></br>

<b> May 29, 2020, at 2:10 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Gah, sorry, got swamped. How is Fuzzy doing?

Dude, why be embarrassed about the BH song? Why the fuck not? I mean, in full disclosure, it's unclear how much control I'd actually have over the music, though I do have strong opinions. Send it along, if you have it recorded. The odds are long on anything happening with this whole project but I'd at least like to hear it.

I haven't listened to Isaiah yet. Sorry. I will soon though. Also I love this idea about the livestream thing. So curious about that.

There's a dude who lives across the street whom Alison has named "The Westsider." He does yoga on his balcony and hustles on the phone the rest of the day. He talks aloud about "practicing mindfulness." We've said hi to him about a dozen times and he has not given us the chance to introduce ourselves. Right now he was just talking on the phone about some stock: "Man, they're crushing it right now. Why didn't we buy in?" Also, he has a gorgeous rental house in Joshua Tree (we heard him give out the website over the phone) that we totally want to rent. There definitely is a difference in mindset between Westsiders and Eastsiders. At first I wasn't sure Alison had him pegged but now I think she's right.

</b> <br><br> Hey. Fuzzy’s doing better. It was real weird. Had to contemplate his mortality there for a minute. I’m glad I’ll never have to do that again…!

There were two songs. I’ve attached one below. You hafta imagine a real singer-type singing it. I dug up the other one, the my-love-for-you-is-no-thing one, and it turns out I never finished it. I will, though. 

Please tell me more about this Westsider vs. Eastsider divide. There’s a lady in my current writing group who is every California stereotype, and I wonder where she’d fit in on this axis. She’s 50ish, beautiful, affluent, says “namaste" a lot. During our Zoom on Thursday morning she was doing some kind of calisthenics that made it look like she was riding a dude who was just below the frame. She recently said that reiki alters “mitochondrial DNA.” I’m not sure that’s accurate. (Right there is a place I’m now tempted to insert your most-hated emoji.)

What’s it like in Los Angeles right now? It can be hard not to be overwhelmed by the fucking shit storm. Then when I’m not overwhelmed I almost feel guilty about it.

Anyhoo. I’m headed to a friend’s back yard for dinner. She’s worked out this crazy system for keeping utensils and whatnot separate, and the experience feels weirdly ceremonial.

We’ll see. Because I tend to expect the worst, I’ve imagined two scenarios which—if they don’t come to pass in the next few days—will be a relief.

<b> Jun 1, 2020, at 8:38 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Real rough here tonight. 

8 PM curfew. A little after 7 Richmond police tear gassed the shit out of a group of protesters at the Lee Monument. No warning, no reason. It was an upbeat, peaceful kind of affair with an inspirational speaker. There were people from the neighborhood there with their kids (bad judgement if you ask me, but still—there were children present). There’s video of one cop running into the fray to pepper spray what appears a teen girl in the face.

A politically connected friend told me that city counselors were quietly advising people to spend the night somewhere other than in the Fan. 

A cop on video spat repeatedly on a cuffed protestor on his knees. The people shooting the video said, “We see you,” and so the cop’s buddy joined him.

My friend was passing out water and signs toward the beginning of the protest. Groups of white young men in cars laughed at her and her staff while they shot video.

There are National Guard armored vehicles all over. Several aircraft overhead. Constant sirens. At one point a group of maybe 200 protestors went by on my street followed by dozens of honking cars that had their back. They were inspiring. But I have to admit that hearing their communal chanting approach from afar was kind of alarming in how exactly like the movies it was.

A few twitter feeds supply info about where the police are amassing. They report that several Blackhawk helicopters have been flying over downtown.

Our fucking mayor asked those who were at the Lee monument to come to city hall tomorrow so he could apologize, as though an apology was some kind of leadership. The guy has been utterly out of his weight class.

I dunno, man. It’s not good.

And then there’s DC.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I’m holding up okay. Yesterday was rough. I’m more of an internalizer when it comes to anger, but I almost threw a big mug at my computer yesterday. The critical thing is that I didn’t. But I nearly did. 

We have this asshole mayor who does nothing and then wants to be the empathizer in chief. He’s black and came in with a lot of credit from the African American community and liberals in general. But at every step he’s been a callow stooge of the rich whites. So he’ll do something that hurts the black community then show up at black community events decrying what’s just happened. That strategy worked for him for a surprisingly long time. After Monday’s tear gassing of peaceful protesters for no reason, he invited the community at large to come to city hall yesterday at noon to hear him apologize. I watched on a livestream. He seemed to think he was gonna walk out and be the soother of wounds.

But like a thousand people showed up, and they gave that guy exactly ZERO quarter. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he’d been pelted with eggs (or worse), but instead, black community leaders just chewed his ass out like nobody’s business. Not that it’ll help in the near term. But it was impressive. And nobody’s buying the guy’s hype any more.

The lack of leadership from top to bottom feels like one of the worst things. Somewhere along the line it’s like “leadership style” got confused with actual leadership, ya know? And the public tends to give too many points for an appealing style.

DC. Fuck. Insane. That picture of the dark White House…

How are you holding up, like mentally?</br></br>

<b> Jun 3, 2020, at 1:30 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> How you holding up?

Nothing in the neighborhood here but, like, thousands chewed out the LAPD chief in a zoom meeting. They all demanded his resignation and massive cuts to the police budget, which is three times everything else combined. 

Turns out BLM has intentionally set protests in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. They want the elite to feel it. Smart. 

I am not reassured by anything happening in DC.</br></br>

Okay overall.

Yesterday I went suddenly insane at 11:30 AM. As near as I can tell, it was touched off by a combination of it being Sunday morning, the specifics of the weather, and being at a brick rancher in a suburb. I looked at the sky and thought, “that blue cannot be real.” What followed was near total madness that never really ended before I fell asleep around 10 watching “Galaxy Quest” for the millionth time. During it there was a part of me grounded in the present just observing the goings-on in my brain. But every other part wanted to bleed to death while at the business end of a gloryhole. Which is to say, it was the worst of the worst of my stuff.  I was in touch with Jean and a friend throughout and took some emergency meds. BUT! This story seriously has a good ending. I woke up as myself this morning. I could see all that shit at the periphery, but only barely. I haven’t felt that bad since 2013, but it used to be that once I lapsed into that stuff I didn’t come out for months at a time. I’m almost glad this happened so that I can see my own healing so clearly.

I suspect that the general stresses in the environment had built up a lot of pressure, and that I got an after-church vibe that pushed me over the edge at my friend’s house.

Amazing things are happening in Richmond. So much is genuinely inspiring. But the most inspiring thing is that the people leading the protests took the announcement of the Lee monument’s removal not only as an opportunity to celebrate, but as a reason to double down. The protests continue to be huge, with a clear set of demands. It’s awesome in the true sense.

Fuzzy had totally returned to himself but then the problem recurred a couple of nights ago. I’m keeping him on the bland diet for a few days to see what happens. 

I’m chipping away at Various Longing. Really enjoying the collaboration with Llewellyn. Glad I turned over most of the visual stuff to her. Kind of aiming for beginning to do the thing in September, but it depends on whether or not she moves in the middle of this. As much as I miss the Humans, there’s something to be said for being forced to work completely alone. I’m hoping it helps me to be less lazy and more demanding of myself. So far, so good I think? So far a lot of what I’ve had to do is figure out how to make Logic, MainStage, Qlab, and OBS (a live streaming app) play nicely together. Kinda dry, but there’s progress.

Man I loved that pic of you, Ewan, and Angus. I’d buy that album just for the cover.</br></br>

I feel confident that Ewan = Larry Mullen, Jr. The question is whether Alison = The Edge or Adam Clayton. This metaphor really breaks down before the end of the first sentence.

Angus = Geddy Lee. Alison = Alex Lifeson. Ewan = Neal Peart. Phew, glad that got sorted.

It sounds to me like you're saying the suburbs pushed you over the edge. I mean, obviously that's what you're saying. What else could it be?

Okay, seriously: that's scary. It's intense that in the end you found it enlightening. I am so so so so so so so glad that it was short lived.

Real question: does Galaxy Quest have a therapeutic value for you?

</b> <br><br> I really do like Galaxy Quest. It’s like The Big Lebowski, something I can put on that doesn’t require much attention because I know it so well. But which I still laugh at. I don’t know about therapeutic value, but it helped me get to sleep the other night. 

Right now I hear an enormous crowd outside on Arthur Ashe Boulevard. It is a sound of such awesome power. It scares me a little if I’m honest with myself, despite obviously supporting everything the crowd is chanting. It’s kinda like “god fearing?” It’s a sense of such visceral power at close range.

Fuzzy is having a relapse of his ailment. I woke up to a sea of diarrhea everywhere. And some vomit, too. He was just miserable. Prognosis is still good. Just needs more meds, special diet for a while. It’s really something to see that dude suffer. Whenever I doubt that my heart works, I guess all I need to do is look at a sick dog. 

Hey, I think it’s more of a U2 picture. Don’t know why. So I’m going with your first instinct, even if it doesn’t really make as much sense. And Alison is definitely The Edge because there’s no way she’s Adam Clayton. I once read an interview with Adam Clayton in which he said, “I may not be the best bass player in U2, but I am the bass player in U2.”

And speaking of U2, have I ever shared my (humble, but expert!) opinion that Bono has written some of the greatest lines in popular song but that nobody gives him credit for it because (a) he’s the frontman of a band and not a solo artist and (b) people love to hate him because of his excess of earnestness?

“I’m sending my condolence to fear…”
I feel like I’m watching someone from a much older age singing. 
That, or Nina Simone reincarnated.

Fuck, this “Gone” song. Wow. What the.

The break in “Gone,” man.

What is he even doing in the back half of “Adios?” Insane. Fantastic.

I have not taken 18 straight minutes out of my daytime concentration to listen to something in ages.

I agree on Bono. I’d add that he’s also written some of the corniest clunkers in popular song but I largely forgive him because it’s usually followed by something astonishing. Someone needs to do a PhD on the effect of Bono’s earnestness. I kind of love that it makes it uncool to like him. More for me.

June is tough on Angus. It’s neighborhood fireworks season (every night) plus allergy season. I spent five hours standing out side a vet yesterday to get him steroid shots. Then he gets his anti-anxiety stuff in the evening.

The boy is desperate to walk. Pulls up on everything. Still happy. 

We’re plugging away. Dying for a vacation but we’re pretty wary of all this Covid optimism. The numbers don’t warrant it.

You stood outside the vet for five hours?!

Fuzzy took up his observation post today after days of laying on his side.

I’ve been okay but haven’t been able to focus on Various Longing as much as I’d like since last Sunday. 

After I wrote that sentence I worked for a couple hours on a new arrangement of one of the songs.  I’m thinking that I’ll appear in profile walking through a desert landscape during this one.

<b> Jun 11, 2020, at 8:12 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Rats. Still, having done that work will make it WAY WAY WAY easier for the next one. Check that NYFA database. The trick, of course, is to make them feel like they're not the first ones to support you. That you've been vetted by other cultural institutions -- even if they don't actually know those institutions. So you tart up the resume a little, as we discussed, but also just drill down hard on what the granting organization is looking for so that you don't waste your time.

Also, FWIW, at this point you can list the upcoming recording sessions with Chad and me, and you can say you've raised at least $1000 in-kind support from me, and whatever else to make it sound like this thing is happening and people are putting in to make it happen.

</b> <br><br> Yes to all of that. I’m disappointed, but not seriously bummed or anything. I’ve put in a call to ask for the panel’s comments. The only thing that could really sting would be if they said, “We love everything about this, but your music SUCKS!” Overall, the week I spent working on this with other people’s help was like going to aspiring professional artist boot camp, and everything that came from process was helpful, even being turned down.

And thank you about the in-kind support and the idea of mentioning the upcoming recording sessions.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Yes! Thank you for this. This is the feedback I need. 

Agreed re. Tracy Pew. I think we’ve covered this in our correspondence? Mesh tank top is a real interesting move!

I’m grateful for this.</br></br>

<b> Jun 14, 2020, at 2:15 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Well, as far as menacing cowboys go, it doesn’t get more terrifying than Tracy Pew. The fake-gay vibe helps. But I also like Iggy Pop in Dead Man.

Musically, what about running the vocals through something? Like a bullhorn or whatever.
I like the opening line. But the music is pretty consonant. Could there be some background element that’s dissonant? You don’t really need a perfectly orchestrated pop thing to carry the vocal lines. I might try stripping out the accompaniment that’s too pretty. Keep one thing, maybe. 
Did you ever see that Cremaster movie with Patty Griffin hanging upside down, singing, with this eerie background? This goes too far, maybe, but it’s worth pondering. The video doesn’t have the images from the film but you’ll get the idea if you imagine Patty Griffin in crazy face paint hanging upside down singing.

The very synthy bass thing is cool but I might try it with a sound that’s more metallic or glass or something a little violent. Dunno, it’s a thought.</br></br>

From here, it’s one of those things that would be easier to kick around in person. But that is both 10x more menacing and surreal and also more interesting and beautiful in its way. That feels like a HUGE leap forward from the first version. It’s hard for me to know what refinements to suggest without knowing what emotional effect you’re going for. Maybe you can walk me through that a little?</br></br>

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Valley of Bliss
</b> <br><br> Oh good! That feedback is so encouraging.

The emotional effect I’m going for…

The story that underlies these lyrics is that Killer (the narrator) takes me to the top of a mountain and shows me a peaceful valley below. The valley is eery, maybe too good to be true, but I really want to believe it’s real. So I ask Killer if it’s real, and he says, “There’s only one way to find out” as he pushes me off the cliff. I fall to the ground and die. There is no Valley of Bliss—it’s a mirage in a desert. Killer goes and collects my bones and reanimates me. Then he takes me up the mountain again. It’s never clear what he gets out of the cycle, what motivates him. Maybe it’s that he enjoys exercising a system of total control? Or maybe he likes possessing secret knowledge and vaguely hinting at it while never revealing it? The one thing I do know is that it’s important to him that I not forget he’s always somewhere nearby. He implies that I am not the only person he does this to.

He’s the kind of bad guy who really seems to enjoy his villainy, really likes to make a show of how casual his violence is. That’s what the off-kilter, jaunty jazz bits and the snaps are meant to suggest. The only other thing I can say for sure is that there’s not much else to Killer besides his violence. It’s not like he has hidden depths. He’s evil and proud of it. His longing only expresses itself in terms of blood lust.

So, like, Sympathy for the Devil, or Black Wings from Bone Machine if it were a first-person story. Also, the temptation of Christ if from Satan’s point of view and if Jesus failed the test.

Also, all this has the vibe of a 70s TV western mixed with cartoonish nazis. Killer is played as kind of a dandy by Jack Palance?</br></br>

<b>  June 21, 2020 at 5:16:30 PM PDT
 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Valley of Bliss
</b> <br><br> Also weirdly I had no idea Jack Palance was even in the original West World. 

But he was a guest star on a now mostly forgotten early 80s show called Matt Houston, and his performance as a psychopath became Julie’s and my standard for CREEEPY!

Thanks again for the feedback. I will be applying it to other songs. 

I’ve given some thought to the ropes. Any rope would snap, I think. But you could use rope to drag Grade 5 steel chain around the legs and then pull it over with a dump truck. On Saturday morning a dude with a gun was caught scoping the scene from the roof of a tall office building. Lots of sad old trolls gun their engines and race by screaming threats. 

Hey, in much happier news: Happy Father’s Day!</br></br>

<b> Jun 21, 2020, at 7:04 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> ﻿
Weirdly this is a little like Westworld. Which has Ed Harris in the Jack Palance role.

I really like this idea. 

You know, I was looking at that Lee statue the other day and I thought: if you just get ropes around the legs...

</b> <br><br> What are things like there now?

How’s work?

And Alison?

And Ewan?

And Angus?

Things here are weird. The Richmond Police Department has really made a spectacle of how out of control it is. Peaceful protests continue daily. What was once known as Lee Circle is now being called Marcus David Peters Circle after a young man killed by police while in the midst of a mental health breakdown a couple of years ago. The circle has a chill outdoor party vibe during the day. There’s a basketball hoop. Food tents. All of which is fantastic apart, obviously, from Covid.

Speaking of which, I’m beginning to get the sense that maybe Fuzzy’s pancreatitis is the result of Covid. He was laid low with a cough and terrible lethargy at the same time I was, and there’s evidence emerging that the virus attacks the pancreas. I get the sense that we still have no real idea about the scope and ramifications of this thing. But Fuzzy’s doing much better now. On lots of meds and still eating special food, but he’s really starting to seem like himself again.

I think I’m losing my way on Various Longing. Feels like I started out with way too ambitious a scope and am being crushed by the thing rolling downhill towards me. So I’m gonna regroup. The purpose remains to create a music / video entertainment that’s more compelling than a living room strummy-strum-strum. Last week my collaborator on this thing—Llewellyn—and I attended a ticketed streaming event on Twitch. It was basically a bunch of binaural recordings you were supposed to listen to while in a dark room. It was mostly a dud, except that the fundamental notion of a ticketed event at a specific time (and with specific participation instructions) definitely worked. That was heartening.

After lots of failed experiments, this morning I landed on a look as a possibility for The Valley of Bliss segment. I’ll probably be riding a cardboard hobby horse. For all I know I am on THE WRONG TRACK.

Please send news. And give my regards to your people.</br></br>

<b>  June 30, 2020 at 2:33:53 PM PDT
 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Yo.

Fuzzy had a major relapse of his pancreatitis. Seemed like death warmed over all weekend. He got IV fluids and painkillers yesterday then again today. Is back on a variety of meds and a special diet. Ultrasound scheduled for 7/15, but hoping to get him in sooner if there's a cancellation. Ultrasound will show if the pancreas is abscessed or necrotic. Or if there's a tumor. Prognosis bad if any of those things is the case. If not, there's really good reason to expect him to recover and just stay on the special food from here on out. 

That's my bad  news. Now other topics:

I like the look of this. I'm trying to think it through, ponder what might sharpen it or whatever. I like this vibe a lot. The only real thing I'm coming up with is a thought experiment: what else might it be other than a cardboard hobby horse? I don't think that's a bad idea at all, I'm just trying to imagine if something could notch it one level higher. Something with some symbolic freight. I don't know what it would be though. But I support this notion of regrouping and lightening the conceptual load. Doesn't have to be the Ring Cycle.

Ha. Nobody loved the hobby horse! I never really tried it. Still might, but probably won't bother. It may be that I'm just holding reins. Just something to suggest that I'm on horseback. I was all set to make a lot of progress this week, but the Fuzzy stuff has left me just kinda blank.

Ewan is really into pulling himself up on things. He seems weeks away from walking. His nonsense chatter has taken on a lot more consonants and he says "mamamamamama" a lot but we're not sure that he's connected it with Alison. He for sure hasn't said "papa" yet. See attached silly video.

I did not receive the silly video! Please send the silly video at once! Let me rephrase that: I demand that you send the silly video immediately!

Angus needs a bath. But we're going to the desert for a week on Tuesday so I'm torn. But it's really for his skin. Spring / summer is rough on him for itching. And of course the fireworks are making him crazy.

I hope Angus has a good rest in the desert. You guys, too.

Alison has busted her ass and gotten down to her pre-baby weight so she's stoked about that. Lookin' good. I've dropped twenty but I feel like I have twenty more to go.

Dang!

I'm glad Fuzzy is feeling better. That's an interesting theory about the pancreas. I wonder if others have had this situation?

A bunch of stuff opened / was about to open here but shut down again. One of our favorite restaurants posted something about how "trash people" refused to wear masks and ruined for everyone. It's true. It's like everyone declared Covid rumspringa and threw a wild party. Assholes. My gym started doing in-person classes again but I'm like: NOPE. We did sit outside at our local wine bar yesterday, which was nice. They're careful about spacing things out and limiting the number of people. But that's as adventurous as we're gonna get.

A couple of months ago I moved from visceral disgust at people's apparent inability to behave morally to a frightened acceptance of it. I mean, I really turned a corner. Hard to believe that my expectations of humanity could get lower, but they have. I guess you can give educated people all the correct information, and half of them will still make anti-life choices. I'm convinced that it's the same thing that allowed the holocaust. The aggregation of a trillion lame "who ME? I'm not one of the bad guys" type decisions.

Mostly, the vibe here that I get from people is exhaustion. At everything.

Yeah. That's generous, but I guess you're right. I get that plus a growing wave of grievance-nursing. The sense of that is probably especially strong here in Richmond.

Work is moving along, for which I'm grateful. I'm using this week to draft a pitch for this feature for Alison's boss about the gay couple who started Wax Trax! records (Ministry, KMFDM, Front 242, all that industrial stuff) and the one guy's daughter who kind of felt abandoned when he left her mother. It's actually really fun and sweet. I never cared about that music but all those people are kind of fun misfit goofballs. LIke GWAR a little bit. I'm doing it on spec because I like everyone involved and because I need to shoot for a movie getting produced. But I have paid work on the Legion thing waiting.

I had not thought of Wax Trax! a long time. I remember them from maybe Throbbing Gristle or Psychic TV or something. I found that world scary when I was a teenager.That sounds like a cool project. Keep me posted.

Weird thing: I had a big Zoom call with all the producers on the Billie thing and we kicked around ideas and surprisingly landed on something that got us excited. Long story short, the woman who interviewed all Billie's friends for the definitive book on her wound up committing suicide / being murdered before the book was edited. So another woman completed it. But there's been speculation that she uncovered something that certain parties didn't want widely known. Who knows. But in any case, to shift the story away from the one that Lee Daniels shanghai'd, we're talking about more of a True Detective type of story, in two or three parallel timelines, that explores Billie, this author, and someone present-day TBD. So if they ever fucking pay me I'll think about that too.

Billie: Whoa! 

Mostly right now I'm looking forward to a week in the desert. It's so quiet out there. No ambient city hum. It feels like richer air.

I hope it's everything you need right now. Sounds glorious.

Ropes around Lee's horse's ankles, that's what I'm thinking. Weakest points.

Soon, hopefully.</br></br>

<b> Jul 1, 2020, at 2:25 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> How is Fuzzy today? Is there anything we can help with?

I remember thinking those Wax Trax bands were simultaneously creepy and sort of trying too hard, or something. I think what I missed at the time was the humor in it all. They were mostly taking the piss. There's a good doc about it (sorry if I already said this) called INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT. They're some real characters.

Hopefully this smaller version of the Ewan clip will actually send.

He seems stable. Pain meds make him a little dopey, but over the last several days he’s shown signs of being himself. I managed to get his ultrasound moved to this week instead of next. It seems like having him on the various meds and the special diet is helping.

Just back. It was great. Super quiet. The dog chased bunnies and sat around in peace. Our friend Taylor joined us for a few nights and she's great so that was fun. We both worked a little but I also read a couple stories in a Thomas Mann collection that I found on our shelf. Interesting cat, never read him before. Great essay about his dog. No real narrative to it but he so nails the mannerisms of dogs. It was hot as balls. Like 100 degrees. But we didn't care. I know I've talked about it before but it's almost uncanny the lack of background noise. I just soaked that up. 

We all got Covid tests the day we left and we're negative. So that's good news. Our daycare lady, however, went to a funeral and a couple people at it have now tested positive. So we're waiting for her to get tested before we take Ewan back. Which means we take shifts babysitting / working for a while. 

That's all I got. I'm a little fried.

</b> <br><br> Fuzzy update: He had the ultrasound today. Pancreas is in rough shape, but it could be much worse. Recovery requires changes in amount of food and its fat content. Evidence that the organ was probably seriously damaged during the acute episodes, but appears to be on the mend. No obvious necrotic tissue. No tumors. 

So basically good news except that managing it in an ongoing way can be tough. Time will tell.

What’s up over there? What’s the Covid vibe? Did LA go back to full shutdown?

Recently I’ve been asking people—like as a thought experiment—if you imagine that the old life is well and truly over…that there never will be anything like the pre-Covid world…would that change your plans? It’s not that I think that’s the case, necessarily. Mostly I’m just curious if anyone would say they were bagging it all and heading for the hills. Feels like the question is especially salient for my friends pushing 60 who have houses they could sell. And also the teenagers I know. 

This morning I’m going through a bunch of old music sketches to find something I can use for a friend’s work video. I love doing this. I hear stuff that I don’t remember making. Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it’s just so hilariously weird and bad that I can’t quite imagine what was going on in my mind!

Like this one. If I couldn’t see that I’d played this guitar part, I wouldn’t believe that I did. Feels like something you’d call “greasy."</br></br>

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #106 / JULY 2020

I lost someone in the last year. It's unknown and unspoken territory to me. I thought it was fine. I thought it was fine. It was a gentle passing. Now shapes and echoes resound. I feel a presence that comes and goes - a comforting presence, gentle and protective. I don't understand it. I don't believe in a god that sits above. I feel a presence in all things - something mysterious and miraculous. Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them. For I love birds and trees especially the sparrows and tall trees with wide branches. It's strange to feel so connected and yet have a feeling of being so disconnected. At times I'm fine - more than fine as they are here and I forget I lost them and my memories hold the space of all things we shared. My question is I don't know how to understand the experience of loss. It's not something I could negotiate with. I hope this makes some sense. ROSE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA
Dear Rose, 
I have printed your letter in full as it describes very beautifully the experience of inhabiting the uncanny and disorientating realm of loss. Thank you for taking such care with it.
The paradoxical effect of losing a loved one is that their sudden absence can become a feverish comment on that which remains. That which remains rises in time from the dark with a burning physicality — a luminous super-presence — as we acquaint ourselves within this new and different world. In loss things - both animate and inanimate - take on an added intensity and meaning. 
I love your line —‘Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them.’
I think this feeling you describe, of alertness to the inner-spirit of things — this humming — comes from a hard-earned understanding of the impermanence of things and, indeed, our own impermanence. This lesson ultimately animates and illuminates our lives. We become witnesses to the thrilling emergency of the present — a series of exquisite and burning moments, each extinguished as the next arises. These magical moments are the bright jewels of loss to which we cling. They are your ‘sparrows and tall trees with wide branches.’
For there is, of course, another side where we lose our resolve — we drop our guard, or just grow tired and descend into that other, darker, less-lovely world, as we disconnect and retreat deep into ourselves.
Rose, these revolving feelings of connection and disconnection you describe so well are the opposing forces of loss that define our lived experience. Letters like yours make a great difference because many of us inhabit this uncanny realm of loss — and all of us will find our way there in time.
Love, Nick

Speaking of St. Nick, this is happening on Thursday: https://www.nickcave.com/news/idiot-prayer-nick-cave-alone-at-alexandra-palace/

I’m “going” to the 10PM EST one.

***

What’s your news?

Please say hello to yo lady, boy, and dog.

***

The out-of-doors is hell’s broiler here.

I’ve put Various Longing on ice. No work lost, though. The biggest problem was how I engaged my collaborator Llewellyn. Despite trying, we couldn’t get it to where it really was a collaboration, where we both brought something to it. She seemed to want to function as a helper. Had I initiated a better conversation at the beginning I’d have discovered that she wasn’t the person to work with on this right now. I blame myself and learned a lesson. Eventually I hope to incorporate the visual stuff we did work on into projections behind live shows.


I’ve started doing little solo shows for one or two people at a time. I always think of you saying, “The last thing I ever need to see again is some dude intoning behind an acoustic guitar.” I’m trying to find out if there is a way to make being a guy with an acoustic guitar more compelling, more transporting, mystifying. Am playing around with having very minimal synth stuff happening. I dunno. I just need to be playing the songs for people.

My only other news is that something real new started happening with my voice about 10 days ago. Suddenly, my vibrato appeared. It reminds me of getting underarm hair in puberty. My voice teacher had said it was there and it would just take time. It’s very modest. But it’s like a thrilling new toy.

***

Asking other people what, if anything, would change if the old ways were really gone eventually made me wonder how I’d answer. I kinda figured that it was moot as I can’t afford to do anything different. But, like, just dreaming out loud:

<b> Jul 22, 2020, at 4:23 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> You know, there’s a place in Malibu where people stay on the beach in RVs. It’s not quite Santa Monica but it’s pretty awesome nonetheless.

You know, the guy who plays bass for Bob Mould, Jason Narducy, does these yard shows, by request. They were house shows before. Now they’re socially distanced. 

You know, I think we will get to do that ‘Mans recording sooner than you think. I don’t know why.

You know, I bet you could get a deal on a used school bus from Gwar.

You know, I didn’t know that vibrato was, like, a latent thing or whatever. I’m always a little awed by singers who don’t use it, sing very plainly, but are in perfect pitch. Rootsy singers, usually. I always feel like my vibrato gets a little sloppy. 

You know, I must have mentioned this but I once played solo on guitar with only string parts coming from my laptop. It was tricky keeping time. I also did a show that involved people downloading stems to their phones and hitting play in unison. That was fun. People had a good time even though it was messy.

You know, I’m curious about that Nick Cave thing. I just bought a ticket to watch Yo Yo Ma play Morricone and stuff on the web. I bet Nick did too. 

You know, there’s not tons of news but I promise that next email thread I will have something awesome to talk about. Not sure how but I will.

---------------------------------------------------------
I know what you mean. 

Speaking of St. Nick, this is happening on Thursday: https://www.nickcave.com/news/idiot-prayer-nick-cave-alone-at-alexandra-palace/

I’m “going” to the 10PM EST one.

***

What’s your news?

Please say hello to yo lady, boy, and dog.

***

The out-of-doors is hell’s broiler here.

I’ve put Various Longing on ice. No work lost, though. The biggest problem was how I engaged my collaborator Llewellyn. Despite trying, we couldn’t get it to where it really was a collaboration, where we both brought something to it. She seemed to want to function as a helper. Had I initiated a better conversation at the beginning I’d have discovered that she wasn’t the person to work with on this right now. I blame myself and learned a lesson. Eventually I hope to incorporate the visual stuff we did work on into projections behind live shows.


I’ve started doing little solo shows for one or two people at a time. I always think of you saying, “The last thing I ever need to see again is some dude intoning behind an acoustic guitar.” I’m trying to find out if there is a way to make being a guy with an acoustic guitar more compelling, more transporting, mystifying. Am playing around with having very minimal synth stuff happening. I dunno. I just need to be playing the songs for people.

My only other news is that something real new started happening with my voice about 10 days ago. Suddenly, my vibrato appeared. It reminds me of getting underarm hair in puberty. My voice teacher had said it was there and it would just take time. It’s very modest. But it’s like a thrilling new toy.

***

Asking other people what, if anything, would change if the old ways were really gone eventually made me wonder how I’d answer. I kinda figured that it was moot as I can’t afford to do anything different. But, like, just dreaming out loud:

I may want to live in a renovated school bus. Am doing lots of research. Probably sounds crazy, but I’m not sure it is.

</b> <br><br> I guess Malibu would do...

But I dunno, after a couple weeks of neck-deep bus research, it seems less practical than I’d thought. I realize it wouldn’t sound practical in the first place to most people. But for like $30,000 it is possible to buy a used school bus and renovate it to an extremely nice standard. Nicer in a lot of ways than your average house. The problem areas are (1) engines, transmissions, and tires and (2) parking when not on the road. The price tag of a problem in category (1) can easily exceed the purchase price of a bus. Category (2) is the harder problem to think-through. It’s more difficult to park a bus somewhere for months at a time than I would’ve thought. Even when it’s off the grid, has a composting toilet, etc. The dream isn’t dead, but it’s sobered up a lot.

I still like the idea of driving around playing minuscule gigs. Did one last night, and it was fun. Decided I’d make little mementos for each one. See below.

The Nick Cave thing was good. It wasn’t transporting, though. It was better than rewatching three episodes of some sitcom I like. The funny thing about Nick Cave is that I love some of his songs as much as anything I’ve ever heard. But then there are wide swaths of his stuff that I only appreciate in very short doses. Sometimes I get bored with the music, maybe? I was struck by how much the songs are like hymns when it’s just him at the piano. As in very Anglican-y cadences and whatnot. The Mercy Seat, Into Your Arms, and a couple others totally slayed.

Vibrato. I love your vibrato. I’m guessing you never really had to think about it, right? Like, you got some coaching in choir about proper technique, and then that’s just how your voice sounded? I’m just trying to get out of my way, let go of all my bad habits, relax all the bodily tensions that keep me from sounding like I’d like to.

I’ve rigged a way to have a faint click track in one earpiece that doesn’t come out of the speakers for playing with other parts. Apple’s MainStage is a lot of fun for all that. So far so good. 

Fuzzy appears to be on the mend. Seems like he has attacks when he’s uncomfortable for a while, but overall his progress is heartening.

How was Yo Yo Ma? 

What’s that baby up to?</br></br>

<b> Jul 26, 2020, at 7:21 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Some people around the corner from us jazzed up a Sprinter van to be a kind of camper. Those probably cost more than $30k without mods, but that seems a bit more manageable on the maintenance front.

2) is easy. Park on the street behind a grocery store or next to a school. That's how everyone does it in my neighborhood. Of course those people all live in their vehicles but no one messes with them. (Okay, real talk: it's fucking sad. I'm gobsmacked at how many people in LA live in vehicles. The rent here is just criminal. I mean it. It's fucked)

This certificate idea is fantastic. 

Long story about the Yo-Yo Ma thing. Bought a ticket, the email said the  show was available for 24 hours starting at 8pm. Tried to play it at 7pm the next day, missed it. Turns out it was 8pm EASTERN. Now I'm pissed and demanding a refund. That's some fucking bullshit on a bunch of levels. First, what's with the 24 hour avail? Is this an attempt to replicate a live experience? Well YOU DIDN'T. Because it's on my TV. Second, BE FUCKING CLEAR in your email. Third, what the fuck.

Vibrato, etc. You know, it's funny. I did do choir and stuff and that's where I learned rudimentary singing technique. But then in the JC years, if you listen, I'm just shredding my voice and it sounds shitty. But then when I quit that, I told Scott Burger I was going to actually sing in the next band, and he was like: But how? And I was like: I just am. And I made a conscious effort to reclaim all that technique. But there are GRB moments when you can hear me being lazy and slipping. It takes some focus to not go too hard one way or the other. When I was in Out_Circuit, Nate had trouble projecting, using his diaphragm, all that, but he could TOTALLY do a convincing Scott Walker imitation. So I said: Then just imitate someone when you sing. Because obviously you can tap into the mechanisms. He never could bring himself to do it -- until he released this last record a year ago. His voice is so much better. It's all so funny.

Someone once called me a "belter" or something. Which I'd never considered before. But in a big way I think Eitzel freed me up to just let it rip. That kind of thing was not cool in our circles, you know? Not just from punk / metal dudes, but even among indie rockers, where it was considered some signifier of phoniness of something. But I always hated indie rock mannerisms. This faux humble / incompetent thing. Such horseshit. I mean, if that's what you've got, then great. But the aw-shucks-ness of that scene. Gross.

I bet Fuzzy has a SICK vibrato.

Baby is up to this -- first trip to the dog beach:

ISSUE #107 / JULY 2020
 
The piano you played for Idiot Prayer was magnificent. Was it a personal instrument, or is this just the kind of thing people put in front of one when they go places? ANDREW, BELLINGHAM, USA

Dear Andrew,

The piano I played at Alexandra Palace was a Fazioli. There were limited pianos I could access during lockdown. There was, however, a Fazioli. I had never played one before but Dom Monks, the guy who recorded the Alexandra Palace performance, highly recommended this piano. The moment I sat down at the Fazioli, its warm, soft, nuanced sound spoke to me like no piano had spoken to me before. I was swept away by its extraordinary tonal range. It whispered to me. It roared at me. It was the most beautiful instrument I had ever played.

On a Zoom call to my manager I mentioned how much I loved the Fazioli. I reminded him that I still have the same nasty little Chinese upright I have had for over thirty years. I explained that I was sixty-three years old and suggested that perhaps it was time I got a nice piano. I said to my manager — I just love that Fazioli.

Now, one of the things you may or may not know about being a famous musician is that companies give you shit for free. The more famous you are, the more shit you get — you just have to wear one of their t-shirts or a branded cap or something. Being the principled individual that I am, of course, I have never sponsored a musical instrument (in that respect, I am virtually alone in my field) but I just loved that Fazioli.

So I said to my manager — Time to sell my soul. Time to make a call and get me a Fazioli.

My manager said — Consider it done!

So, the next day my manager rings up Fazioli, who have their headquarters in Sacile, in the Province of Pordenone, near Venice and an Italian woman answers the phone.

My manager says — I represent the great artist Nick Cave and I am wondering if I could get a free Fazioli (or something like that).

The Italian woman says — L’acttore?

My manager says — What?

She says — The actor?

My manager says — No, Cave. Cave.

And she says — Nick what?

My manager says — Nick Cave.

She says — Nick Cave? Who issa Nick Cave?

My manager says — Well, he is arguably the greatest songwriter of his time. He is one of the cornerstones of modern music. He is a national treasure. He is adored by millions. Italians love him.

She says — Who are you? What you want?

My manager says — Um, a free piano.

And she hangs up.
 
* * * *
 
A couple of days later I’m on another Zoom call with my manager, and he is looking a bit cagey and I say — How did it go with Fazioli? Did you get me a free Fazioli?

And my manager says — Well, it seems like they have a rather inflexible policy around giving away £200,000 pianos to people they’ve never heard of.

And I say — Dude, are you my fucking manager or what? I just love that Fazioli!

So the next day my manager rings back Fazioli and the same woman answers the phone and my manager says — Look it’s Nick Cave’s manager again, can I speak to Mr Fazioli.

And the woman says — No.

And my manager says — Listen, my fucking job’s on the line here.

And she hangs up.
 
* * * *
 
So, Andrew, I agree — the Fazioli is a glorious piano. Magnificent, as you say. As Herbie Hancock said about his Fazioli — that ‘one note announces the celebration of the freedom and creativity of the human spirit’. This is true. The Fazioli is warm and delicate and remarkably subtle, but has a deep, strong heart. It is full of angel tears and il sangue dei santi and encompasses the universe. It is a dream piano.

And yet I wait for the day a giant removal van will pull up outside my house, my manager hanging out the passenger window, wearing a t-shirt with a piano on it, and a big smile on his face, screaming ‘Fazioli!’

Until then my little Chinese upright grins at me from the corner of my room. I walk over and sit down and I begin to play.

Love, Nick

</b> <br><br> It feels like longer than a year, like two or three years. I don’t know why that is. Maybe because so many things have happened in the world at large.

I am mostly well as far as Julie goes. Mostly. I have not experienced the release of all of my anger towards her. For the last few years, that’s mostly what I felt. I’ll be spiritually better off when I don’t feel those spikes. At the same time, I do find myself remembering various small, sweet moments. In jokes and the like. Those memories feel like a relief from my darker ones.

Hunter is kind of an emotional black box. Talking about how he feels is not really his thing. He seems more or less the same as he always has. He’s keeping busy.

Natalie isn’t going to start feeling her feelings until she’s 30. Which might not be the worst strategy overall. I don’t know. 

Jacob is the one who can articulate what he feels when asked. He does not miss Julie. He actually said he figures someday he’ll miss having had a healthy mother. She was sick with cancer from the time he was 6, and her mental illness was the water he swam in his whole life with her. The fact that at 17 he can even form those thoughts seems promising for his future.

Thanks for asking.</br></br>

<b> Jul 28, 2020, at 12:43 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I missed the anniversary of Julie’s death. How are you doing? How are the kids and Hunter?</br></br>

<b> Jul 29, 2020, at 3:20 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> My friends Liza and David live in a tricked out Sprinter. They’re in Maine right now. A van is definitely the better option in almost every way. Except that I’m not made of strong-enough to live in a van as a full-time residence indefinitely. And I figure that it’s an either-or proposition in my case. I do wonder, though, about sharing a house with people to lower my rent and then spending lots of time out and about in the van. Just dreams for now. I like the full-circle symmetry of my mid 40s' dreams being both the exact same and also very distinct from the dreams of my 20s.

That sucks about the Yo Yo Ma thing! He should come play in your yard. 

You’ve told me that story about Nate. I think he and I are in the same boat. I sang in a choir as a kid, but we didn’t really get any instruction. So when I started singing in Schwa I was just kind of yelling some approximate tune. I amassed a trove of bad habits, all of which boil down to holding lots of tension. I think that tension has fucked up my relationship to making music. I think it’s why there’s so much distance between the music I love listening to and the way the music I make sounds. I mostly started playing guitar as a way to cope (obsessively) with home life. I’m a very tense guitar player. Feels almost ridiculous to be retooling all of this at this late stage, but not really. What it really feels like is spiritual rebirth. 

Also, I think Benjamin Clementine has pushed me over some edge, maybe in the way you say Eitzel freed you up. I keep needing to be reminded that songs are not about the data they contain. That performing songs includes craft but totally has to aim for something past craft. I’ve tended to aim for craft without even knowing that was what I was doing. It reminds me of the REM lyric where Stipe sings, “I skipped the part about love.” 

Fuzzy is well enough to be routinely annoying. So that’s a relief! I have never known a dog with such a distinct persona. If his persona were a scent, it would be real heady and completely overwhelming in any room he entered.

I love that picture of Alison and Ewan (aka Lil’ Bob).</br></br>

<b> Jul 30, 2020, at 4:16 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Re Clementine — Fully agree. Such a weird epiphany too. I’ve thought a lot about “something past craft.” Here, it’s my daily struggle. But in music, my whole post JC thing was premised on the idea that I already understood pop songs, I was trying to push beyond craft to something else. Then I kinda reeled it in for “Flesh and Spirits” since I realized no one got that I can write pop songs in my sleep and I needed to demonstrate that a bit. It’s kind of funny, that assumption that it was understood I had a grasp of pop craft is probably what sank my chances at any success. It’s like, The Cure had to write “Boys Don’t Cry” to prove they could do pop songs which allowed them to then write dark sprawling moody things like “Faith” which was then taken seriously because clearly they meant to do it. It’s also why every songwriter here just looked at me askew when I did shows, because they’re all pursuing a distillation of craft, and I was trying to blow it up. I really like this direction you’re heading.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> You said something very similar when I was visiting, about being able to write pop songs in your sleep. I wasn’t sure I understood. Like, I think what you’re saying is that if you had to, you could crank out verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus songs about Jack and Diane (or whatever) all day long. But that it would be super boring and pointless. I could not do that if my life depended on it, at least not the lyrics.

But to me the GRB songs are primarily magnificent pop songs...as in incredible lyrics, interesting arrangements, and great performances. (I say “pop” whenever I mean “folk” as in not-through-composed-art-song, etc.) To me they’re just qualitatively better pop songs than that other kind. And good pop songs are pretty much my favorite kind of art. 

Obviously, I always worry that my stuff is in the meat and potatoes category! Sometimes I think I’ve risen above it. Or that maybe I can. But I basically live in horror of making the same kind of stuff the people who looked at you askew made.

It’s a weird preoccupation for a grown-ass man in any case.</br></br>

<b> Aug 4, 2020, at 8:14 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Thank you, that means a lot.

Yes, I think I could crank it out as you say. Blargh. I do think the purposely reductive lyrics would be harder though. That actually might do me in on that score.

GRB is certainly pop songs. I assume my ear tends toward catchy pop whatever probably because I grew up on Barry Manilow and ELO and stuff like that, so it's my starting place. My native language. I never had any exposure to anything more sophisticated until I was in my teens. And I found that to be a place to explore. It seemed potentially more expressive, or expressive in different ways.

You know how pop hooks have elegant shapes. I tried to explain that to Jason Caddell once but I don't think it came across. Anyway, if you can see the shapes then pop hooks are just easy and obvious. (So are the ones that fall short.) I think trickier music had different shapes, or shapes I didn't immediately comprehend, so that seemed more fun. That's what rocked my world once I sat and analyzed the sheet music for "Fratres." Fuck me, the shapes. I had never fucking dreamt it could be done that way. I mean, I heard it and knew it was amazing and was moved, but the fucking rigor of the progressions... Simple, like pop hooks in a way, but like a 3-D chess version. Just supernaturally elegant. You probably felt that way about Steve Reich back when you discovered him. Man. It's Bach-level shit. I dunno if I could ever achieve anything like that.

The lyric stuff took a long Long LONG time to get anywhere. 

You absolutely ARE rising above it. If I were you, I wouldn't second guess why now. Just run with it. We've talked about the late bloomer phenomenon. Sometimes that's how it works. I'd be fucking excited. I hope you're fucking excited. Shit, I'm excited on your behalf. What a great place to be.

</b> <br><br> I’d never really thought of pop hooks as having a shape, but that makes sense. I mean, a literal hook is particular shape. I wonder who first applied the idea of a hook to a musical phrase that gets stuck in your ear.

I hear you about the rigor and, like, parsimony of Arvo Part. It’s as if those pieces couldn’t be anything but what they are. It’s one of the most mystifying traits of great art to me that it seems like it just had to be there / couldn’t have been anything else.  It can fool me into believing that it must be easy to do. The thing is, I still don’t find pop hooks all that easy. I’m glad when one arrives. It could be that I’m just rejecting the most pandering and obvious ones. 

Thinking about this made me put on Part’s Beatitudes. I figure the organ explosion at the end is like a sped up restatement of the harmonic change that came before it? But yeah…the sense of logic / precision / inevitability

I’ve looked at a lot of Reich scores, and they just make no sense. They may look like how they sound, but they definitely don’t look like how they feel to me. 

Thank you for the encouragement about where my stuff is. I mostly do feel good about it. At least I feel good about the doing of it, you know? Like, it feels good to feel compelled to keep going. Played to two friends in a park last night. I have this one song that’s obviously a love song, but less obviously is a love song about the antipsychotic medication I take. Throughout the whole thing a schizophrenic dude across the park ranted in torment. Not sure that song has ever resonated more for me than during that. 

Other than all that, things are still here. I’m trying to spend more and more time without distraction from the loneliness. Trying to go towards it, into it. In the “vanity of vanities” scheme of things, right now seems like a decent time to focus on less vain stuff.

It's weird how my introversion works. This is the first time this has become a thing. But her mom is coming down to stay and help with Ewan, so that's great. And then in late October she's coming down again for her birthday. The thought of this is gonna get me through the coming month.

But everyone's good. Planning for Alison's 40th on Halloween. Trying to get people together, but not too together. Need to come up some gift ideas.

A month sounds like a pretty long time from now, but I’m glad the idea of it will get you through. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be with two other people all the time, even (maybe especially) the two people you love most keenly. I mean to say that I really cannot quite imagine it, as in — I try to imagine it but I quickly feel insane. Man, I hope you’re finding little pockets of alone time here and there. I bet it’s not easy to do that right now. 

I played one of my mini shows last night, and it was pure pleasure. Front porch. Crickets and cicadas. Candles, just the right level of semi-oppressive humidity. It was for a friend of a friend, someone I’d met years ago in passing, whose name is Sarah Hand. She is married to Phil Nunnally. I mentioned you and Phil was amazed at the coincidence. He said you were the first person he was ever aware of who was in an actual band and that he though you were incredibly cool back in high school. He also said he sang in the choir with you, which I found kind of amazing, coincidence-wise since that’s something you and I have talked about recently. He struck me as a genuine, kind dude.

Alison’s 40th. Hmm. I remember that when my parents and their friends had their 40th birthdays, there’d always be black balloons with “Over the Hill” printed on them. What an awful generation!  Does she have any clear feelings around it? Seems like it’s a big deal to some people, not a big deal to others.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> This plan sounds wise. A month sounds like a pretty long time from now, but I’m glad the idea of it will get you through. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be with two other people all the time, even (maybe especially) the two people you love most keenly. I mean to say that I really cannot quite imagine it, as in — I try to imagine it but I quickly feel insane. Man, I hope you’re finding little pockets of alone time here and there.

<b> Aug 12, 2020, at 1:19 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I love Phil Nunnally! What a great guy. Yeah, we did choir. We were also both big music nerds, though he started out knowing a lot about classical but he took to underground rock like a fish to water. I remember being kind of surprised when he mentioned discovering and like Joy Division. I think he later did a radio show at UVA or JMU or somewhere. He was this sweet, brilliant, kind of nerdy dude. I thought he was great. Man, he probably has college-age kids. That’s hard to picture. I just envision him as that same dude from high school. I also know the name Sarah Hand but I’m not sure why. If you see him again, tell him I said hi.

Alison kind of started the solo time thing. There was a night when I had a Zoom or something so she just went to the local wine bar (outdoor seats, etc.) and read her book. A think she used to do all the time as a single person. She talked about how great it was and I was like: Hey… So last night I did that. It was real nice. But three nights in the desert is going to be a whole different level. No one to answer to. Man.

Alison doesn’t seem to have strong feelings about turning 40. Though I’m not totally sure. That stuff has a way of sneaking up on people. But I think she’s looked forward to the party aspect of it for a long time. We booked a room at this resorty type place in Palm Springs and a few other couples are doing the same. So she’ll have booze and friends and food to distract her.

“Over the hill.” Ugh. That sucks so hard. Those people were scared as fuck. My mom still is. Not only did I not care, I made no plans for it (a friend surprised me with a gathering at a bar, which was nice), and legit felt like I was only just hitting my stride as a person. And barely begun in this profession. Same for 50.

Man, I’d love to go to one of your micro shows. I mean, I guess the “show” is the same, it’s the audience. But yeah. How do you find places to play?</br></br>

</b> <br><br> He credited you with introducing him to Joy Division, I think? I might’ve gotten that detail wrong, but he definitely mentioned Joy Division. Phil and Sarah do not have kids. 

I really believe that at this point in history people tend to hit a certain stride in their 40s that maybe a few decades ago would’ve happened in their 30s. Does that seem right? You couldn’t pay me enough to have another go at either my 20s or my 30s. My 40s are where it’s at. I was 40 when I was in the funny farm, and it’s been onward and upward since then!

Forty is jorty? Theme party in jorts? I realize that’s trying too hard.

Playing tonight for the Humans drummer Greg and his wife Susann. I don’t know them well.  I just ask people if it’s something they feel like they’d enjoy and give ‘em a big obvious way to say no thanks if it’s not for them. So far, so good. Although I talked with Jason yesterday, and I could practically hear him breaking out in hives at the prospect! We laughed. Man would I ever love to do one of these in your side yard there. That would be the best setting imaginable. Someone would probably need to be in the pool to make it just right.</br></br>

<b> Aug 14, 2020, at 12:30 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Alison volunteered to be the one in the pool. That would be awesome. We just replaced the crappy yard sale table with a custom built farm table. That is, after our woodworker neighbor quoted us like $3500 to build one and we had to politely demur. I got a guy off Craigslist to do the same basic thing for $450. I mean, it's the shitty knockoff version but it'll be fine. I'm not that fancy yet. And but so anyway, we can seat four -- socially distanced -- at that table, plus a couple on the couch and maybe one or two standing around. That would be a great show.

I am a big advocate for the 40s. It seems clearly to be prime time for a lot of people. I love that. It's weird, though, isn't it, how people used to have such different lives that they'd marry and have kids around the time you and I were just starting to get out of bed before noon? And a generation or two before that they'd have like a bunch of kids. Now it's like: maybe we should think about being grownups once we're in our 30s. I mean, for some. I dunno how I got the life I got but so far it's only gotten better. Maybe because it sucked so hard starting out. But why be a downer? Let's just say it's because guys like us are still curious and engaged and forced to reinvent ourselves periodically. That seems like the positive spin. Nowhere to go but up!

Forty is thwarty
Forty is Morty
Forty is sporty
Forty is whorty
Forty is 

Man, I wish I could hang out on a porch with Phil Nunnally and just talk about weird music and shit. That sounds like a blast. I'd like to hear about his life.

How did the show go?



</br></br>

<b> Aug 14, 2020, at 6:28 AM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> I will dream about the Massey yard show. It’ll be like a North Star in my imagination. That audience sounds huge! I did one for four people, and it was like playing an arena.

Last night’s show was beautiful and heartbreaking. The drummer in The Humans is Greg Weatherford. Maybe you remember him? He played in Spike the Dog around the time that we were all playing Twisters and Metro. He played with the Linkous brothers in various combinations up until the first Sparklehorse release. He did not end up on that  record because Mark Linkous started over with different people. Then Greg was the first drummer in Cracker. Didn’t end up on that first record either. Jim Keltner, one of Greg’s heroes did instead. He’s a journalist turned PR guy, and he has that flinty toughness that a lot of reporters seem to have. I like and respect him, and he’s hands-down my favorite drummer I’ve ever played with. But we haven’t been friends outside of doing music together.

Greg is married to a novelist named Susann Cokal. That book trailer music I sent you was for her current book. I’ve known for a while that Susann was suffering from some complex physical problems that also affect her cognitive functioning. But I had no idea how much she was suffering. Their house has a real southern gothic vibe. Its yard makes it feel secluded. There are peacocks around a lot, like it’s a Flannery O’Connor setting. Humidity, cicadas, big old trees. Susann seemed like she was having a hard time standing and completing sentences. She essentially has a migraine that never goes away. She had to sit inside on the other side of a closed window because her hyperacusis makes music painful at too close a range. Greg treated her with such tenderness, and I could see that they know each other and love each other in the middle of a situation that has to feel like an unending Gethsemane. My heart practically burst.

So I played for just Greg, and under the circumstances it just felt like the best thing two people could be doing for those 30 minutes. 

As I woke up this morning I thought of the perfect “forty is…” But I’d forgotten it by the time I had my coffee.</br></br>

That performance situation last night is so vivid, you make me feel the difficulty and the sweetness. Man, what a bummer situation for Susann. It almost seems like a weird fable: her sitting on the other side of a close window, drawn to but also repulsed by the sound of music.

Me:

(1) I’m coping with what may be the last of the abuse I haven’t been able to face and its effects on my life as I try to live it. It’s beginning to feel like the hellscape aspect of it is finite. I’m time traveling all the time between the present and the 1970s, but it feels purposeful and even hopeful. Please don’t feel like you hafta say something about this. It’s just that it’s the answer to what is up with me.

I also love that Tannon and Pen all chime in liking what I assume is kind of pop music. I mean, I know they like all kinds of things, but it still amuses me.

I feel at a loss about stuff, like everybody. I think of you guys as living in an inferno even if the fire’s not too close to you. The looming election. And now Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Fuck.

Today’s the first anniversary of this iteration of TB&TH’s first show. Can it get better? Maybe!

I’ve slowed down on the shows but intend to do as many as possible during the autumn.

Some simple but urgent guidance to get us through these next months.
I awoke on Saturday, September 19, with three sources in my mind for guidance: Etty Hillesum (1914 – 1943), the young Jewish woman who suffered much more injustice in the concentration camp than we are suffering now; Psalm 62, which must have been written in a time of a major oppression of the Jewish people; and the Irish Poet, W.B.Yeats (1965 – 1939), who wrote his “Second Coming” during the horrors of the World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic. 
These three sources form the core of my invitation. Read each one slowly as your first practice. Let us begin with Etty:
There is a really deep well inside me. And in it dwells God. Sometimes I am there, too … And that is all we can manage these days and also all that really matters: that we safeguard that little piece of You, God, in ourselves.
—Etty Hillesum, Westerbork transit camp
Note her second-person usage, talking to “You, God” quite directly and personally. There is a Presence with her, even as she is surrounded by so much suffering.
Then, the perennial classic wisdom of the Psalms:
In God alone is my soul at rest.God is the source of my hope.In God I find shelter, my rock, and my safety.Men are but a puff of wind,Men who think themselves important are a delusion.Put them on a scale,They are gone in a puff of wind.
—Psalm 62:5–9
What could it mean to find rest like this in a world such as ours? Every day more and more people are facing the catastrophe of extreme weather. The neurotic news cycle is increasingly driven by a single narcissistic leader whose words and deeds incite hatred, sow discord, and amplify the daily chaos. The pandemic that seems to be returning in waves continues to wreak suffering and disorder with no end in sight, and there is no guarantee of the future in an economy designed to protect the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor and those subsisting at the margins of society. 
It’s no wonder the mental and emotional health among a large portion of the American population is in tangible decline! We have wholesale abandoned any sense of truth, objectivity, science or religion in civil conversation; we now recognize we are living with the catastrophic results of several centuries of what philosophers call nihilism or post-modernism (nothing means anything, there are no universal patterns).
We are without doubt in an apocalyptic time (the Latin word apocalypsis refers to an urgent unveiling of an ultimate state of affairs). Yeats’ oft-quoted poem “The Second Coming” then feels like a direct prophecy. See if you do not agree:
Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.
Somehow our occupation and vocation as believers in this sad time must be to first restore the Divine Center by holding it and fully occupying it ourselves. If contemplation means anything, it means that we can “safeguard that little piece of You, God,” as Etty Hillesum describes it. What other power do we have now? All else is tearing us apart, inside and out, no matter who wins the election or who is on the Supreme Court. We cannot abide in such a place for any length of time or it will become our prison.
God cannot abide with us in a place of fear.God cannot abide with us in a place of ill will or hatred.God cannot abide with us inside a nonstop volley of claim and counterclaim.God cannot abide with us in an endless flow of online punditry and analysis.God cannot speak inside of so much angry noise and conscious deceit.God cannot be found when all sides are so far from “the Falconer.”God cannot be born except in a womb of Love.So offer God that womb.
Stand as a sentry at the door of your senses for these coming months, so “the blood-dimmed tide” cannot make its way into your soul.
If you allow it for too long, it will become who you are, and you will no longer have natural access to the “really deep well” that Etty Hillesum returned to so often and that held so much vitality and freedom for her.
If you will allow, I recommend for your spiritual practice for the next four months that you impose a moratorium on exactly how much news you are subject to—hopefully not more than an hour a day of television, social media, internet news, magazine and newspaper commentary, and/or political discussions. It will only tear you apart and pull you into the dualistic world of opinion and counter-opinion, not Divine Truth, which is always found in a bigger place.
Instead, I suggest that you use this time for some form of public service, volunteerism, mystical reading from the masters, prayer—or, preferably, all of the above.
        You have much to gain now and nothing to lose. Nothing at all.         And the world—with you as a stable center—has nothing to lose.        And everything to gain.

<b>  September 25, 2020 at 10:00:14 AM PDT
 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> You know I’ve been working for 20 years on managing the effects of growing up in an abusive household. I’ve made so much progress. In the last two years I have for the first time ever had a general preference for remaining alive rather than dying on the spot. But certain things could still just take me over sometimes—images, desires that didn’t feel like my own, waves of powerful suicidality that felt puzzlingly sexual. Sometimes I just find myself standing somewhere with no memory of how I got there.

It’s bizarre what it is possible for a person to both know and not know, to remember in a narrative way sometimes and as a bodily sensation at others. Or memories that lead up to something that suddenly goes black. Or, in the case of someone like me with dissociative identity disorder (what they call multiple personalities these days), wholly independent self states with their own autobiographical memory that can’t be accessed by the rest of me.

I haven’t dated or had sex in over two years. I quit drinking in May. I started meditating all the time. My disability check covers my rent, so there’s no sense of anxiety there. There’s nowhere to go, nothing to be distracted by. So stuff started coming up.

The long and short of it is that there was prolonged, violent incest in the McCready family during the 1970s. I have both known and not known. The secret was enforced with violence and threats to my and Julie’s lives. My father created more than one mock execution scenario where I believed he would kill me. My father routinely practiced sadistic medical torture on me while he was in a revery of power. My mother physically used me all the time for the satisfaction of her sexual needs when I was a toddler and sporadically after that. I have always known the feeling of an erect adult penis in my mouth and throat, and throughout life I have experienced the desire for the repetition of that, but independently of positive feelings of homosexuality or human warmth. That is to say, the desire didn’t feel like it was my own. For some period of time I was punished by being made to drink urine and eat feces. Our parents treated us like objects for their sexual and/or sadistic use. They constantly said sexual things about how we looked from the time we were little kids until we no longer had contact with them. They were also involved, through their church, in a community of people whose relationship boundaries and heavy drinking allowed some form of swinging. Children were not protected in those scenarios. It seems like my mother actively pimped me to at least two people in that group.I don’t know who else besides me and Julie was affected.

But the good news is, this is it. This is the bottom of the barrel. Beyond these traumas, there are no more. The goal is to set this enslaved child free. He is separate from me and reluctant to talk for fear of being killed. But there’s real progress. I’m much more stable than in 2013 or 2002-2005. There are things I want to do in life now, like play more of these yard shows.

All of this has a strong spiritual component. I believe that my parents committed “soul murder” on me and Julie, creating a real sense of death in life. They deprived us of any sense that life was worth living from the beginning. So everything that relates to rebirth feels eerily literal to me these days. On the one hand I was lucky to fall apart in proximity to Jean, who has spent her career focused on cases like mine. But also, I’m fortunate to have retained some capacity for friendship. Without those two things, I’d have been dead by 2005. I perceive that god is woven throughout this story. God’s vulnerability, specifically. 

I think I’m gonna make it. Recently I’ve gotten goose bumps out of the blue along with the sense that maybe life could be good, not just tolerable. I have a profound feeling that your prayers help.

It also helps just to be able to tell this story and have it heard. At times I deny it all five minutes after writing an email like this one. So, when people who care about me hold the story, I don’t have to hold it alone.</br></br>

The band followed DeYoung's lead with their next project, Kilroy Was Here (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the rock opera form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Everett Righteous played by James "JY" Young. Kilroy Was Here featured DeYoung in the part of Kilroy, an unjustly imprisoned rock star. Tommy Shaw played the part of Jonathan Chance, a younger rocker who fights for Kilroy's freedom and the lifting of the ban on rock music. This future society is served by robots. Called Robotos, these automatons perform many jobs, and several serve as Kilroy's prison guards.

I meant to tell you, I had this total bandmemes666 dream the other night. I've probably lost some details now but what I know is that I had this gig where I was supposed to improvise songs on the electric guitar with a delay pedal. Yet I was anxious because I hadn't rehearsed. Also I needed to change the strings and I didn't have any. And no tuner. And I was onstage. Except it was in this grassy outdoor situation.

Basically, it was hell. 

I don't know why I have music anxiety dreams.

I also have lots of "moving into a new place and having to whip it into shape" dreams.</br></br>

I’m okay. Have been getting together with some of the Humans in Doyle’s back yard for a few weeks. Yesterday was the third time, the first that our drummer’s been there. It was massively enjoyable. I’m playing guitar in this version. Not sure I’ve mentioned it, but our guitar player Ben also went to college for jazz guitar. Also dropped out during his first year. He went back and finished, though. When we are both playing guitar we get real dorky about chord voicings.

It turns out that getting together with other people and playing music with them is fun.

I have pretty long hair now.

Am playing a yard show tonight. It’s for Valley’s birthday. I think I’m gonna get into the full Timothy Bailey garb.

Life is powerfully strange recently. I am enormously grateful for moments of repose like I’m having this morning.

</b> <br><br> These yard shows have all been 6 songs long, but this one was different because it was for Valley’s birthday. I was gratified that they demanded encores. That does not always happen.

I’ve been doodling that particular cat since high school. 

I like that you said I “could” consider pigtails. As though I had not yet considered them.

What’s news there?</br></br>

<b> Oct 7, 2020, at 8:55 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> News: someone stole an Amazon truck at gunpoint nearby. So that's exciting. I no longer seem to get updates from my Citizen app about such things, which frankly is fine. I kind of wonder what the robbers hoped to find?

We had friends over to sit in the yard and drink and eat tacos. Everyone but Alison accidentally tied one on. I never do that on purpose anymore. I was genuinely flummoxed when I stood up and found I was drunk. So dumb. They left their car and came back in the morning and they looked ROUGH.

Had a long IM chat with Chad last night about all kinds of fun dumb stuff. He just now texted me something about getting a DM from Eitzel. He's giddy as a little girl.

Had a good notes call with my producers and director about the Legion script. Basically it was the call you dream of. The director opened with: "Incredible." He only had one minor note. I don't think that's ever happened before. I've been coasting a bit on that. 

Ewan is a little cranky. Not sure why. He got shots this week and they warned that it would take a while to work through his system so maybe that. Or maybe teething.

Alison is coming up on her 40th bday. She has lost 60 lbs since the peak of her pregnancy weight. It's insane. She's so skinny. She's really into it. I won't lie, she looks good. She's been super diligent. A bunch of people are going out to Palm Springs for her birthday and her goal is to look good in a bikini. It's funny, I think the "milestone" birthdays do that to people even if you think they're kind of arbitrary.

What ho?

Alison’s birthday is the 31st, right? Palm Springs sounds fun. I’ve heard that even broke people there drive real nice old cars because they never rust.

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #119 / OCTOBER 2020
 
I was thinking how much I wish I could write this story to you in Greek, my native language.In June one of my best friends suddenly died aged 46. He was a sailing buddy for about 20 years, since I was 18. We have sailed up and down the Aegean Sea for thousands of miles. We had booked a sailing yacht for the whole of August, just the two of us, to go sailing in the deserted - due to Covid - Aegean. He was getting married in September, and this was meant to be our own, peculiar, spiritual, bachelor party. We would take with us our music, our books and our drugs. And we would sail where the wind took us. When August came, I decided to go ahead with the journey on my own. I nailed a picture of him, Fotis, on the cockpit and begun alone, though many friends wanted to come along. But I wanted no crew. I felt somewhat like Ahab beginning a doomed voyage. I thought I should spare any crew.I took with me 4 full discographies. Yours, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, and the greatest Greek of the 20th century, Savvopoulos. And two books, Moby Dick by Melville, and Odyssey by Homer.A week in the journey this happened. I was doing a long night sail. I always enjoy night sails. The wind was light and fair, no land or human in sight. No sound from an engine but the sails gently flapping in the wind, and the bow slowly advancing through the water. I was traversing a large stretch of water eastwards, from Mykonos to Patmos. The Milky Way was shining on top of me like a crown of all that has ever been. Ghosteen was on the speakers. I was having my coffee and my morning joint (you will hopefully not share this with the Hellenic coast guard!) all alone in the very first light.As the sun begun to break from the horizon (as I was travelling eastward), Galleon Ship entered. I stood there, all alone, watching a thousand-galleon ships sailing, "ghostly around the morning sun."I broke down. I was overwhelmed. It brought me to my knees. I was kneeling in the cockpit, in the twilight, moving slowly towards the sun, crying my heart out. The closest to a prayer a non-believer can experience.And then of course, the way you have the album arranged, Ghosteen started speaking to me.
I am beside youI am beside youLook for me
Suddenly everything made sense. I could physically sense and see the Ghosteen. Everyone singing to be free, broke free. I could almost physically sense all that has ever been, and all that will ever be. Everything had somehow clicked in my head. Loss was okay. It was only part of the game. The beauty of it all came in the foreground. I rose up and smiled at the emerging sun.So I guess all I'm trying to say is this:1) I want you to know I can see and sense the Ghosteen. It will be with me forever. Until I close my eyes.2) Thank you.STATHIS, ATHENS, GREECE
Dear Stathis,
You Greeks are the best.
Love, Nick

Deadly Teddy. God. Is that how movies like that happen? Someone writes a thing like that as a joke…it gets sent around…one thing leads to another?

You ever listen to Bill Frisell's music for Go West? I have not. But maybe now I will. Anyway, maybe get him to score the Jim Jarmusch movie. That’s my advice.

That’s really exciting about Legion. Keep me posted.

Not sure if I’ve ever sent you my song “Great Man Singing?" It’s the one that starts with the line “On Marlon Brando’s island we drank wine from human skulls.” Played it for Doyle recently, and it reminded him of Chris Elliot’s Brando gag from Late Night with David Letterman. I’ve been enjoying this in small snippets. So far, the best one starts at 13:27:

DEADLY TEDDY

LOGLINE: When a Chinese thermonuclear device disguised as a teddy bear is mistakenly sold on Amazon to an American nursery school, a retired thief must steal the truck and comb the truck's inventory of teddy bears for the deadly teddy before nuclear armageddon wipes out his daughter’s entire class—and the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. And his ex-wife, who really isn’t so bad and put up with his job for a long time with minimal bitching and frankly looks hot in that tank top so maybe there’s something still there. Except Chinese goons just took her hostage.

I like anything Thewlis. I haven’t seen S3. But I’m surprisingly amped for Chris Rock in S4.

Legion: Thanks! This is all shifting and a bit above my paygrade, but as I understand it, next steps are to assemble a “package” of actors and then take it out to sell to networks / streamers in Europe. Pretty standard procedure but I don’t know buyers over there at all. The best case scenario is multiple interested parties so you have leverage to get the best deal. In Europe, production has started up again, so my producers are gung-ho to get it out there. (Here, production is only now slowly ramping up. But Alison has one show back in production and another about to start.) 

It’s a good question about big changes. I’m not totally sure. Generally, I’ve been unaffected as my routine hasn’t changed. But the market is kind of skittish in the U.S. until January probably. That’s partly from Covid, partly from the election. There may be a glut of material being sold, which could hurt me somehow. The situation with closed theaters does make it difficult to even pitch a movie, but everyone’s assuming that will go back to something more like normal. 

Buster: Jim Carrey’s team passed. Not surprised, really. It’s out to some other actors. But also I came across a clip of Jim Jarmusch talking about his love for Buster and how he often goes back to those films, so I’m gonna try to get it to him. Not sure if it’s within his means to make but I like the idea.

Alison’s birthday is Halloween, yes. Palm Springs is such an interesting place. Not quite my speed but fascinating. A Mecca for mid-century modernism. Big gay population. Tons of golf. Kind of resorty. Feels like a piano bar as a town, almost. I dig it for a couple days at a time but then I just want to go to Joshua Tree, which has more funk. 

I think we listened to the new Rufus once. I concur with your Froom philosophy though. Froomize it! Get your Froom on! Froom all over it! Actually, I think Froom was weirder and more interesting when he was still teamed up with Tchad Blake, so maybe that’s part of it. 

“Time-traveling therapy” sounds like the basis for a thriller.

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> TLDR: 

Sometimes statements like this are a person’s best effort to define a reality they find fundementally confusing—and to form community with others who are similarly troubled.

Sometimes statements like this are recapitulations of a person’s narcissistic wounds, a kind of manipulative commodification of suffering designed to elicit shallow, quick-hit validation.

Sometimes an individual tends to use one or the other of these strategies exclusively. Other times, an individual may vacillate between these strategies. Still other times, a person may employ both strategies simultaneously. Most people will not have consciously considered which strategies they’re using.

I followed this lady on IG who did a lot of body image stuff. She was a photographer and her photos were only of herself. She posted as much nudity as IG would allow. IG frequently prohibited some posts, and she would then post about how absurd it was that IG had blocked her work, how that only validated her point of view about imagery of women’s bodies. All the points she made felt right. To disagree with her work, her (basically third-wave feminist) points of view, or the way she engaged her audience would’ve been to invite a shit storm of cancel culture reproach. And for some good reasons.

I struggled with my reaction to her account for months. On the one hand, I admired her fierceness. I thought, I could learn something about insisting on owning my reality here. I quietly supported her insistence on depicting her body in a way that left her feeling empowered. On the other hand, I thought, “These all look like a certain kind of high-minded 90s fashion spread with a questionable veneer of women’s empowerment.” It felt at times like she was posting sexualized imagery of herself (sitting in bath in a teddy, looking into camera with parted lips) and then insisting, “this is merely the female form."

Ultimately, I unfollowed the account because it was unhelpful to me in a personal way having to do with my own past. But while I was deciding whether or not to unfollow it, I found myself trying to figure out how to discern what was happening in that kind of situation. And maybe I’m wrong, but I felt like that was what you were getting at with the Maria McKee post. Is this person sharing a painful truth about herself to make things better or to remain fixed in how bad they are?

For me, one of the keys is vulnerability. The IG poster’s work had none. She claimed that it did, but I couldn’t detect it. I don’t begrudge her the anger that ran through her work. I’m pretty sure that if I’d had her experience in the world, I’d be similarly angry. So it wasn’t the anger that ultimately put me off. It was the closed-loop vibe. “Here are sexy pictures of myself that I substantiate with a political view of my sexuality. If you do not endorse that point of view, you are the problem.” The closed loop is invulnerable. It’s circled wagons. I guess I felt like my viewership of the photos was extraneous. 

She was someone I know as an acquaintance and totally the kind of woman I’d have wanted to date in the past. I’m gonna run into her at poetry stuff when the world starts spinning again. If I unfollowed her it was possible she’d notice and would likely be unpleasant when I ran into her. But I unfollowed the account because—for me—that combination of sexual intensity, grievance, and invulnerability added up to dangerous narcissism, and I’m trying to run in the other direction from that whenever I can.

A separate (but probably related) dynamic is that where early abuse has occurred, healing takes forever. People who’ve left childhood with a corrupted operating system are—in part—children attempting to negotiate an adult world. Our immaturity causes cascading problems, each of which is as difficult to deal with as the one that spawned it. The path to recovery can feel endless. At the beginning of the path, a lot of us insist (despite the evidence) that there was never anything wrong in the first place. It can take years just to admit that we have a problem. Then years more before we believe that something so upside down could ever be put right-side up. So for a lot of us, there is a phase where we are powerfully identifying-in with our problems and our efforts to ameliorate them. We acknowledge that we are sick after years of denial. We feel proud of our efforts to become well. We find validation in a community of fellow sufferers who are in a similar phase. All of that is truly good for us. Until…it becomes an end in itself.

I’ve seen that a lot…where the goal of being well disappears behind the necessary step of acceptance. It’s like, “For years I didn’t think the way I burned myself all the time was a problem. Then, through tons of hard work, I realized that it was a problem. I learned why people end up like that. I accept that I am like this. People do not get like this without serious injury to their sense of self as a child. I’m pissed. Most people never have to lift a finger psychologically speaking, and I’ve had to do years of heavy lifting just to be able to not want to kill myself every 10 minutes. This is as good as it’s ever going to be for me. Now I will join my brothers and sisters who live with me in this dark corner, and we’ll support each other while raging at the world.” I say I’ve seen it a lot, but I’ve also been there myself.

The thing is that during this phase it’s easy to start seeing coping with mental illness…therapy, meds, etc. etc. as an end in itself. In my own case, it’s really only over the past two or three years that I’ve started to see that there’s anything on the other side of all the work. Namely love and increased freedom. There’s just a long damn time in the wilderness. You hold on to whatever you can, even if it’s something as meager as identifying-in as a mentally ill person. I have a friend who is a fellow sufferer who I don’t think is likely to ever move beyond this phase. She seems to view the work as being about continuing the work. She does not seem able to see it as a path towards anything more loving or more free. And who can blame her? She’s felt like trash her whole life. At least at this point, she doesn’t feel like trash. Belief that one might actually be able to live a life doesn’t come easy.

In my own case, as far as statements like Maria McKee’s go, I’ve so far held my cards closer to my chest when it comes to public statements. In the past, I have been barely able to tolerate telling the truth of my experience to half a dozen good friends. There has been nothing linear-in-time about my awareness of my psychiatric problems. If I were to have posted a big mental health day advocacy statement on a Monday, I might have felt mortified on Tuesday, like I had been a malingerer demanding sympathy. For decades my view was that “life’s purpose is to be a good sport about life’s purpose…is to be a good sport…” I had little to say that was any more hopeful than that, so I didn’t say much about it publicly. 

Obviously, that grant application was a shift. In the future, I do expect to be able to more publicly address the story of my life. Either through some kind of writing project or (hopefully!) through the Timothy Bailey stuff. When I do, I definitely hope I can do it in a way that includes my vulnerability without being manipulatively solicitous of people’s pity. The world absolutely does need more credible information about mental illness. And more to the point, about the abuse of children that happens next door. At the same time, the world sure as shit doesn’t need more commodification of people’s grievances or easy-to-endorse “best life now” influencer posturing.

This stuff is tricky!</br></br>

It reminds me a little of the polyamorous pod I knew briefly. My response to them wasn’t about the fact that they enjoyed sharing intimacy with multiple partners. I mean, among consenting adults who the hell cares, right? It was just that they were so boring! One way or the other, conversation ALWAYS wound up being about their sexuality.

<Great Man Singing.mp3>


Great Man Singing

On Marlon Brando’s island we drank wine from human skulls 
while we played lawn darts on the beach. 

We took shots at helicopters full of European journalists 
who’d come to take the great man’s measure. 

At night we watched old training films about
safety in the sawmill. 
Marlon laughed at all the
bad fake blood. 

We took our meals in silence
like two monks aboard a spaceship,
going nowhere and hideously bored.  

The island was a dream,
but Marlon didn’t say much
‘til he hit me with a club to watch me bleed. 

He said, “You give a guy a pass 

when he’s good at playing creepy
or when he makes you laugh,

he works you like a dummy. 

When staring in his eyes
is like staring at still waters

you become a great 
white flower, and

a newborn baby’s cry

ricocheting off the mountains
can’t capture your attention

when you hear the great man singing. 
You think the song’s about you,

when even if it is,
it’s still a murder ballad. 

But you give the guy a pass

when he’s good at playing creepy. 
You know he wants to make you cry,

but you still long for his comfort.
He understands your horror

since after after all, he made it — 

like a god who’s gone to seed
and demands perverse devotions.  

You give the guy a pass
‘cause he’s good at playing creepy 
when he’s good.</br></br>

 / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> /  Re: Now.
</b> <br><br> Maybe 15 years or so ago I read how Marlon Brando asked visitors to his island to leave a stool sample when they departed.

I’d think about that from time to time. Like, how far out must someone have gone to ask a thing like that of guests? How totally enabled from outside must he have been? How do accomplished and prominent people  hide transgression in plain sight…like Obi Wan Kenobi saying “these are not the droids you’re looking for?”

Brando was 48 when Last Tango in Paris was made. The actress Maria Schneider was 19. She consented to the butter / rape scene but was profoundly hurt by it. It was sprung on her last minute, and she didn’t feel like she could say no. Purportedly, Brando left all the blame for that at Bertolucci’s feet. But Schneider characterized Brando as being cold to her about it, like he was only doing his job and so on. Why couldn’t Brando—who was otherwise apparently a deeply empathetic guy—find some other way to respond?

To me, the Kurtz compound at the end of Apocalypse Now is the most convincing portrayal of horror I’ve seen in art. And Brando is totally convincing as the architect of that.

He’s also convincing on Dick Cavett when he describes the plight of African Americans. So way ahead of his time (as a rich white dude) morally on race stuff.

It all just makes me wonder.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Thank you so much for this feedback about the song. I didn’t want to mention it specifically ahead of time, but I share your feeling that the “punchline” undermines the thing. I really want it to be from Norman Bates’s point of view, and I want the listener to know that, but saying it feels kinda false for the reasons you say.

	•	What if I just repeated, “I remain yours truly,” but never signed off? And then the title made a more subtle reference? 
	•	Another option would be to say, “Norma” instead of “mother” in the first line. In the novel, Norman’s mother is named “Norma” (which is itself a little goofy, right?)
	•	Third option is just drop the idea that the listener ever gets a direct clue about who’s singing. 
I have no other mechanism for getting this kind of critique, so I appreciate it a lot.

"I feel like I have this kind of weird filing system for time — like, it tends to all fan out instead of snaking along in a chain — which I think makes certain past things more present than certain present things. So maybe that’s part of it. Hard to articulate.”

Oh yeah. For sure. Yes. There’s nothing spookier than the passage of time. And it’s all a lot more hallucinatory when scrutinized than it feels when not scrutinized.

It is interesting about Jettison Charlie. I wonder what that’s about.</br></br>

Men in livery. Silver charging plates, all that fussy business. I remember standing at the windows, looking out, and feeling pretty lightheaded. My parents let Julie have a glass or two of wine with dinner, and she got so drunk she literally went face-down in her dessert. Like in a cartoon. 

I can’t imagine being that jazz trio. Those guys could genuinely shred! And don’t worry—I’m sure they all died from ODs long before 9/11. 

Speaking of shredding, I’ve kept reading these letters and just came across my teen self insisting that Steve Vai is really cool despite what he looks like and telling Emily how I heard Vai say in a interview that he always goes to a mall the day of a DLR show and that I forgot to go to Lynnhaven Mall yesterday and that if I therefore missed my chance to meet Steve Vai I sure am gonna feel like an idiot!</br></br>

I almost wish I didn’t know his last name, or something. It kind of cuts the knees out from what I took to be a darkly funny, harrowing tale. I wonder if there’s an approach to that reveal? Like maybe instead of singing in his character, it’s some other narrator who identifies with Norman Bates but doesn’t have the excuse of a movie, or something? Totally spitballing here. I just didn’t want the feeling of realism yanked away at the end. But maybe if I listen again I’ll be more onboard, we’ll see. Just thinking aloud. 

I really love the dark jokes where you don’t know whether to laugh. The first time I ever played “Garofalo, C’est Moi” was a real lesson in that I played it totally straight and confessional but people just roared with laughter because you’re not supposed to say that shit out loud. I took careful note.

Re my note above I also think about the genius of that Sufjan moment in “John Wayne Gacy, Jr.” where he says “look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid.” Fuck, that song… It’s a totally different affect from what you’re doing, so maybe not applicable, but I think you want maximum “OMG” somehow, you know? 

Okay, you didn’t ask for any of that. I love the song.

I’ve got a really small “thumb drive,” if you know what I mean.

I’ve always had music-related anxiety dreams but back in the day it was just related to my feelings of failure. I have no idea why I’d be so worked up about Jettison Charlie all of the sudden. I usually have screenwriting anxiety dreams where I’m trying to solve a story problem and I go in a loop all night and it’s exhausting. I feel like I have this kind of weird filing system for time — like, it tends to all fan out instead of snaking along in a chain — which I think makes certain past things more present than certain present things.

Personally, I feel like “heavy” is (in retrospect) a great misnomer of acts like iron butterfly, because they were heavy in comparison to their peers, but even Black Sabbath isn’t *that* heavy in the way that heavy is known now. And maybe what that is now wouldn’t speak to him. Anyway, I wouldn’t worry about the heavy part; I bet he wants the connection and your insight more than anything else.

<b> Oct 30, 2020, at 9:26 AM / J Nathan Burke <jnathanburke76@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> A few things come to mind…but no “homerun”/obvious one I can think of, but off the top of my head: 
	•	Karp “S/T”  - 30 mins, riffs, to the point, relentless, awesome.  My only complaint with this one is it’s not exactly hi-fi and isn’t going to blow anyone’s mind in that regard.  The production is sort of endearing in an underdog kind of way.  
	•	Mastodon …a few of them but maybe “The Hunter”.  Definitely a more commercial option…a bit like what Hot Topic is to goth, but I still dig it.  
	•	Not stoner rock AT ALL, but the latest Meshuggah record just because it melts people’s faces.  Maybe too much of a jump into the deep end?</br></br>

<b> Nov 13, 2020, at 10:15 AM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> So last night in my dream, when I woke from a nap, I looked out the window and saw you waiting in your car. Checking your phone. Since it was Sunday I figured you wanted to go do something. I was pondering how best to jump out and surprise you but I had to pee. So I snuck out the back way and drove a few blocks around to the place where they’d let me pee. And then it was all different. So sorry I missed you. I liked your sweater.</br></br>

Here: mostly just fucking relieved that the world is a little less on fire than it was last week. There are days now where I don’t even look at the news. Too toxic, too breathless. But everyone around me feels like we can breathe again.

Alison keeps sending me houses on Zillow. It’s pure porn. We don’t have money for a house. Especially here, where a place that would cost $300k in Richmond would be a million bucks. A MILLION DOLLARS. When I was a kid I thought a million dollars meant I’d never have to work again. Now it’s just something you dump in a hole. 

Everyone’s cool. We went out to Palm Springs for Alison’s birthday and a few other folks joined us. Super fun. Just two nights but it felt so good to be in a different headspace.

Angus got a bath and now he’s super clean and fuzzy (small F). A clean dog is a nice thing.</br></br>

<b> Nov 23, 2020, at 5:50 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Hiya. 

I also remember when a house that cost a million dollars seemed like it was a super rich person’s thing. I do not get how anybody affords anything ever. 

I’ve started making Fuzzy’s food. It’s chicken, sweet potato, rice, and a multi vitamin. He is seeming healthier. It was rough for a while, so it’s great to see him being so full of vim and vigor, by which I mean piss and vinegar. 

Did you see the drsmashlove post with the dog in a tub splashing like a maniac? I kept trying to think of a way to make a joke about that being either you or Alison in your pool, but I couldn’t quite get there.

Have been practicing outdoors once a week with scaled-down Humans. Snare drum, two acoustic guitars, bass. Learning new songs, talking lots of shit. It’s been real nice. 

I recently looked at the TBTH IG account to find someone’s info and was surprised to see that Mark Eitzel follows it. Makes me afraid to ever post anything on there again. 

I got hooked on the great British bake off. It’s like Thomas the Tank Engine for adults. But what kind of animals create entertainment in which contestants make totally unnecessary food—which the viewer will never taste—and then submit to the judgement of imperious unnecessary food experts? I guess that’s a rhetorical question. I guess I wish I could write Netflix shows’ blurbs. 

Fuzzy is conked out at my feet on the couch.

Sometimes when Angus has been sick we’ve made him chicken and rice. That shit is magic. And he is a fiend for it. I love that Fuzzy now has a chef. In addition to his chauffeur and personal assistant. He really needs to file paperwork for his LLC and branding.

Oh, band shit talking… I miss that. Please pass along good examples.

I feel you on the Eitzel thing. So my question is: how does a guy like Eitzel wind up following us mortals? I mean, what’s the pathway?

I watched one British Bake Off. Not really my jam. I know people love it. It does have the Mighty Boosh guy, I guess. But I don’t really get it. I do love the new Queer Eye and Somebody Feed Phil, though. Have you seen either of those? The latter, especially, is pure pleasure.</br></br>

<b> Nov 25, 2020, at 6:12 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> ﻿One of the things that comes up a lot is endorsement opportunities. We would feel really good about being the official band of Discount Medical Supply on Arthur Ashe Boulevard. We think it’s a natural fit based on our demographics. But also, it’s where we get our CPAP supplies, so it just feels like a genuine connection.

Greg uses a variety of textiles to cover his drum heads depending on what kind of dampening he’s trying to achieve. So recently we all had a go at him about his inevitable Modern Drummer cover where it’s just him with like this squalid towel over his shoulder and a real smug drummer’s facial expression.

So, like, then…how he conditions the towel, the stories it’s seen on the road. He accuses Doyle of having washed his towel since we practiced last time, doesn’t sound right. Etc. The bit in the future Humans documentary where people share various disgusting stories about having abused the towel.

Three of us love Arby’s, and before the pandemic we’d make recordings of whatever music was playing while we ate our curly fries and send them around to one another. As often as not, either Ben or the other Greg would own the album or at least know who it was by. I’m talking, like, smooth jazz. But anyway, it’s probably trying to punch above our weight, but some kind of endorsement deal with Arby’s would be a dream come true.

Anyways. I’m sure Eitzel just follows people back. I’d really like to believe he watched me make that bill sandwich, though. 

British Bake Off is basically terrible. It’s narcotizing. If it included an element of pornography it’d be The Entertainment. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s the perfect way to be not-present. 

I have not seen Queer Eye or Somebody Feed Phil. Will probably check them out after the current season’s Bake Off finale. I’ll need something to stave off the withdrawal.

Here’s a one-mic outdoor recording from last weekend of us playing that new song you helped me with. I look forward to fucking it up a lot more when we can make more noise.

But Angus, while he's fine with the baby in principle, could do with a bit less direct prodding from Ewan. Like, take about 20% off. So that requires constant vigilance. 

Last night I watched this live(-ish) stream of The Hold Steady doing a three-night stand from the Brooklyn Bowl, which is a standing tradition of some years. My friend Jeff I've known since college, he's one of the three guys I keep up with. He usually goes to the event every year. Obviously this year there's no audience but people piped in from all over the globe via Zoom. It was fun. We mostly just jabbered via Facetime while we watched the show. That's what I wanted anyway. He's hard to get one-on-one time with. But he, Mike Halverson, and my friend Greg Geddes had this "band" called Metafish that played two shows--one of which Jeff spent in the hospital for an appendectomy so Mike got Bobby Donne's hesher brother to show up and just shred over their songs, which had the effect of driving everyone out of the venue. It was glorious. You can hear me guffawing at top volume on the recording. One of the funniest things I've ever seen. To this day I don't know Bobby Donne's brother's name, we just called him Lars.

Jeff's wife Jen was one of the most vital athletic fierce women I ever met. She now has MS and can't walk anymore. I can't even imagine it. It's crushing. They handle it with incredible aplomb. They have two boys, 18 and 15. The oldest is musical, the youngest wants to be a cinematographer (which is maybe the most specific teen goal I've ever encountered). I came home just now and started looking up a particular Simone Weil essay on suffering I may send him.

Today was... taxing. All the usual stuff. Plus it's Sunday which I am hardcore about reserving for leisure, reading, coffee, recharing. I need it, bad. But then we have these friends who were very casual about their Covid precautions and the woman exposed Alison, potentially. They were across a fire pit outdoors with masks on, but then the woman's whole family had it. We knew they were not taking it seriously enough. So Alison pulled Ewan from daycare and they both got tested. Negative. It's now 8 days without symptoms. But our daycare provider said we need to stay out 14 days. Which is wholly sensible. But it was a blow. There's a rush to end the year at work and we're both under the gun. But there's no other option. This is small potatoes in the grand scheme but we weren't expecting it. We thought he could go back tomorrow, which is acceptable per CDC guidelines. Anyway. Dumb shit. But it requires calibrating expectations. And he was kind of a shit today. So we're just tired already and we have a week to go before we get a break. We'll manage, it'll be fine. But you know.

In truth, everyone around us is suffering far worse things, likely including yourself, so it's unseemly to bitch about something that's so minor. 

You should be thankful it's an F#. The black keys are the best ones, as everyone knows, so maybe you should just shut the fuck up and count your blessings asshole. 

We went to the park and saw many many dogs but no puppies. I want to see a puppy now. Make yourself useful and send a puppy our way. Shit.

</b> <br><br> For what it’s worth, the situation you describe sounds pretty damn stressful from the outside. Two adults, a baby, and a dog in a house all day and then a COVID scare on top of those stresses and work. I think that’d give most people hives. I’m so glad Alison and Ewan have tested negative and haven’t had symptoms. That’s scary. And it doesn’t sound minor or like you’re bitching.

You’ve mentioned this story about Bobby Donne’s brother. I wish I’d been there. How did the other members of Metafish respond while onstage playing? 

Do you remember The Sausage Brothers from Richmond? It was the band of a guy named Brian Klouse (not sure about that spelling). They’d put on these weird rock musical things at Twisters. One was called “Bad Ronald.” I think Ricky played the character of Bad Ronald, with like an orange pompadour, a fat suit, and maybe painted-on freckles. Someone else was Satan. It was menacing and confusing. And one of the most entertaining things I ever witnessed in a club. I’m not saying it was good—just genuinely strange. I remember that one of Brian’s rock operas began with the screamed line, “He shot outta his mothers ass!” That night might be my Metafish.

The weird thing about the F# in my left ear is that it is exactly 1480hz. I mean it’s dead-on an F#. I have a tuner that’ll play pure tones, and it matches as perfectly as I’m able to hear. None of this microtonal bullshit for my tinnitus. I can sing other notes against it and experience the harmony. It’s not a big problem or anything. Just real weird.

Yesterday I found myself dreaming about making the Timothy Bailey and the Humans record for the first time in a while. That felt REAL GOOD. There are long spans of time when I respond extremely negatively to my songs and/or my performance of them. Much shorter spans when I think they’re all masterpieces. But I feel best when I don’t evaluate them at all and just get on with it. Damn I’d like to make that record. That would genuinely feel like getting on with it.</br></br>

I’m falling behind on my utilities. Internet is off, and others are probably close behind. If you’re able to, could you help me pay them down? If you’re not able to, of course I totally understand. 

Thanks,

Tim</br></br>

</b> <br><br> Well, big deal or no, thank you again. I now have all my utilities paid, and that's a big relief. 

Right now I'm laying on my huge couch which I'm pretty sure is going to smell like an old man died on it by the time the world starts back up. It's a hand-me-down that was a hand-me-down to the friend who gave it to me. We used this couch in the writing space. When we got it, it was incredibly comfortable. After that solo show I played in 2017 (first time I'd played out in like 8 years), I drank too much out of residual nerves, walked back to the studio, and slept on this couch. Very comfortable. I napped on it over there a fair amount, too. Eventually, it made its way to Valley's house. Then her mother in law gave them another couch, so they had to get rid of this one. When it arrived, it had changed a lot in the year between the writing studio and my apartment. I don't know what it lost. Its resolve? I've done what I can with it, and it's definitely more comfortable still than the torture implement of a sofa I had before it. But, like, Fuzzy hurled on it a while ago, and while I scraped off the solid chunks, I never cleaned the stain. He doesn't seem to mind. He's conked out over there right now. This couch is long. I'm 6' even, and I can lay head-to-toe on this thing and he still has plenty of room down past my feet. When my feet do graze his belly or one of his feet, he growls ferociously. 

TV show idea: Billionaire is at a Davos-esque conference listening to some other billionaire do a TED talk-type of thing. You see on the seated billionaire's face that he just realized what a douchebag everyone there is, and then somehow you see that he knows he's a dick, too. 

Anyways, he leaves. And then sets about giving his fortune away. The show is about everyone who tries to ruin or kill him for it. Scenarios where his largesse causes big problems. Geopolitical intrigues, etc.

It's got a bit of, say, Touched by an Angel in that the acts of giving can warm your heart. A little West Wing because it's teaching you stuff. But it's also a thriller because his actions cause lots of problems for powerful people.

Anyways, there ya go. That's my pitch. I'm done.

How are you? Is Ewan back in day care? How is your sanity? Alison's? I've lost touch with the news about the state of lockdowns there. What's it like? Any chance of another getaway anytime soon? What's up with stuff you're working on? Any news about the Legion project? Do you have a Christmas tree? And so on.

Today's new Letterkenny day. The trick now is not to binge it all at once. 

For Christmas I got us a beginner's weed vape from MedMen. Which, if you don't know, is basically the Apple Store of weed shops. It was actually great, I went in and said I needed a gift for a new smoker and they totally walked me through the options. You just take a hit on this thing and it vibrates when you've dragged one dose. So you always know how much you're inhaling. I've only used it once and didn't get high at all, but I felt a little "relaxy." In my experience, weed either a) puts me to sleep, or b) causes horrible psychotropic shit. Which is why we want to use under controlled circumstances and figure out what the real gradations are. Alison has used it a couple times with the same effect. I would like to be high, though. Not just relaxy.

(...he said, infamously, before it all went to shit.)

I am actually pretty into that pitch. I think you need a stronger inciting incident (always sounds redundant to me, but that's what it's called) that gives him some clear reason to realize he and the others are dicks. But I especially like the idea that the other rich douches' game gets fucked up because of what he's doing and they try to stop him by escalating means. 

As for us, lockdown is pretty intense in some ways and less so in others. There's no sit down dining, only take-out. Any retail is limited to 3 people inside at once. A lot of business are closed or out of business. ICUs are at 100% capacity, which is scary. People a couple degrees removed are indeed dying, mostly older people. But no one sees that so it feels a little abstract. I heard that in the 1918 flu pandemic people would vomit blood on the street and stuff, so it was a lot more visceral. Ewan is indeed in daycare, thank God, but when he's not we go to the park at least once a day. People distance and wear masks but I think everyone has given up on the notion that Covid might be spread by going down the slide. Though I'm not sure it would matter, the caution tape on play structures was the first thing to get ripped down when quarantine began because there's only so far you can push parents until they're just like Fuck it. Ewan naps once or twice a day for like an hour each time so that really helps the sanity levels. He's usually pretty even keeled but he just requires constant stimulation, which is taxing to us. 

We had, in a fit of optimism, booked a getaway to Mexico for right now but things got bad so we cancelled. We probably could have gone, technically, but the stakes are high. For one, the government banned non-essential travel. For another, if we showed symptoms while in Mexico it would get sticky fast. Would we have to stay there? Would we have to lie to get on a plane home? It just seemed stupid and asking for it. 

Legion is going out to actors once the break is over. We have a list of favorites. In my experience, that's a somewhat tedious process because you can only send to one at a time and you have to give them a couple weeks to read it, each. But it may be different when you're making a paid offer (which we are) rather than hoping for an unpaid attachment (which is what I've seen before).  There are a few name actors on the list but there are also some really exciting up-and-comers. All British. The one I'm most stoked about is Paapa Essidou (sp?) who's on I May Destroy You. He's great. This sweet looking black dude who's Shakespearean trained. I'd love to see him start out kind of doughy and nice and have to toughen up over time. 

Otherwise, I turned in a pitch for the WaxTrax feature and I'm trying to finish a new take on the Billie Holiday thing. Not sure what the chances are with either, for different reasons, but I think WaxTrax is more likely to move forward. In other news, Alison has been helping develop this network sitcom called Call Me Kat, which involves the main actress from Big Bang Theory. It's a redo of a British show called Miranda. It's fairly charming for a goofy network show. But Alison's bosses fought to get her a producer credit on it and she got it. It's a good step. Those network shows are still cash machines, so she'll see some fraction of a percentage from that. 

We have a tiny Christmas tree. Most of the ornaments are felt animals. 

Also, Ewan likes to climb in the car and push the buttons. Today -- somehow we couldn't figure out -- he turned on the radio. The Weeknd was playing and he just spontaneously started dancing. He does that. It's super fucking charming. 

What's the scene in RVA? What did you do for Xmas? How are Hunter and the kids? What's the news on songs?

I’d never even considered that the meaning of the phrase, “roll over Beethoven” was about rolling over for Rock and Roll. But, that’s true of so many songs that were ubiquitous when I was a kid. The lyrics got in there before I could really hear them. Afternoon Delight, for instance.

My guess is that Tchaikovsky is towards the top of the list of composers people can name, thanks to the Nutcracker?

Also: I thought you meant musical citations. And I was like, “Man. That’s deep. That is so beyond me.” Like casually recognizing some passing motif in a Lady Gaga song as having referenced the Adantino from Symphony No. 4 (which, obviously, I had to google to learn that it exists.)</br></br>

I tend to like a lot of the same stuff that weed devotees like. But sadly, it’s a nightmare drug for me. I’ve experimented with indica and sativa in different amounts and different modes of delivery. But it just makes me much, much crazier. The good feelings that people describe when a little high sound so good! I’m glad there are increasingly good ways to know what your getting and in what quantity. Makes for good experimentation, I guess.

That’s exciting about Legion. What’s next after lining up the actors?

And how have you changed the Billie Holiday story? 

Congratulations to Alison on the producing gig. Wow. That’s good news.

I don’t like the sound of the ICUs being full to capacity. I don’t understand how that works. I’m sure that if I had the heart to I could look this up, but I guess I don’t understand what happens to people who require intensive care because of a non-COVID illness or injury.

There’s gotta be some recent video of Ewan dancing, right? 

I’m trying to write this email while listening to music on headphones. Makes it much harder. Can you listen to music while writing? I suppose it’s different if it has words or not. This does, and it makes my words harder to come by.

Music-wise, not a lot happening here. Been working on a couple of little guitar ditties. Finally getting around to fucking with MainStage and my guitar synth plugin to make it so certain notes at certain dynamic ranges trigger other things. Like, if I play a chord with a specific note in it, it can trigger one of those warbly Eno-esque pads I like. Oh, and Doyle leant me his baritone guitar. It’s tuned B to B, and the open B chord rattles your bones without sounding muddy. It’s a good feeling. 

I checked in with the core group of Humans about where they are in terms of wanting to make the record. I felt like I’d said a lot about it, but that they hadn’t really weighed in. They’re way more into it than I knew. We’re trying to have a conversation about what we want out of it creatively, recognizing that a lot of what it becomes will depend on what happens during the making of it. But I’m trying to get us each to think about what we’re aiming for. For my own part I’m trying to critique my own tendencies that can suck the air outta my songs. In woodworking there’s this idea that if you aim for perfect, you’ll get work that is good enough. If you aim for good enough work, you’ll get scrap.</br></br>

I heard Chuck Berry sing “Roll Over Beethoven” last night and he says “…and tell Tchaikovsky the news.” Which just struck me as such a singular thing to say. Like, first, it’s Beethoven and Tchaikovsky who are being pushed aside by Rock ’N’ Roll. Why those two specifically? It’s a long spread between those two guys, chronologically and aesthetically. And wouldn’t there be other candidates? Also, this assumes a certain familiarity in Berry’s audience with Tchaikovsky, which I’m not sure you could count on now. Anyway, I thought it was a weird funny choice. I was into it.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> I heard a radio thing about this documentary. It sounds super compelling. I like this idea.

MainStage is basically Apple’s Ableton Live. It uses all the assets in Logic, but is designed for live performance rather than recording. It would be possible to load all of the effects processing a band requires into a set list and manage all of that in the app. So far we haven’t used it as band, though. From a solo performer’s perspective, it allows a flexible organization of all the synths, amp simulations, effects, etc. in an easy-to-see interface that can be controlled by any midi hardware. Like, for the songs I’ve done solo with it, there might be three different guitar tones (each with a variety of effects) that I select with a foot switch. Maybe there’s some compression, reverb, and delay on my voice. Maybe I switch the vocal effect for a specific part of a song. MainStage makes that stuff easy, and also…visible onscreen. 

I just recorded a guitar synth thing I’m messing around with. Hoping to be able to play it with a bit more subtlety after some practice. The guitar part is doubled with a vibraphone patch. Then other stuff gets triggered by particular notes. Like the F# in the octave about middle C plays a bell. The F above middle C plays a bass pad. That C# does like a wind thing. And so on. I guess the point is more tonal coloring and atmosphere.

This is all in one setting, without the ability to modify it while playing. That would be a next piece of the puzzle. As it is, the bell on F# rings a bit too regularly.

Sometimes I lament that the guitar is kind of a sucky instrument. It will never do for me what a piano does. So I’m starting to think about augmenting it. To really make this a thing I’d have to spend lots of time with it. For now it’s just fun to hear those sounds in my headphones.</br></br>

<b> Dec 31, 2020, at 2:02 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> ﻿I am not that smart. It would be pretty rare for me to just hear some motif like that. 

I think Roll Over Beethoven is also sort of about a girl. I don’t think she’s Beethoven though. I think he needs to rock n roll for her (innuendo? probably) so tell Beethoven and Tchaikovsky the presumably bad news that they are no longer number one in their hearts.</br></br>

<b> Dec 31, 2020, at 2:57 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> As for Billie, I think I told you how Lee Daniels did an end run around our producers and has made a feature that's essentially the same story we were going to tell. Tessa Thompson dropped out because of that. So I sat with the producers and we kicked around new approaches and came up with something. I don't know if it'll actually work but my hope is that it'll get this thing far enough down the road that I can get paid the rest of the money they owe me. Which is actually so little that I almost blew it off. But anyway. The new idea is to approach the story like True Detective. The main story is the same one about Billie versus the crooked narcotics agents and her romantic involvement with one of them. But the framing story, in the 70s, concerns Linda Kuehl, who was a young pretty white feminist arts writer who became obsessed with Billie, and overidentified with her in some dangerous ways, but who did 200 interviews with Billie's family and friends and collaborators in order to write a definitive biography. There had been an earlier "autobiography" called Lady Sings the Blues that was ghostwritten by a tabloid reporter who sexed / drugged it up for maximum scandal. That became a movie in the 70s with Diana Ross. But it's widely discredited now, mainly thanks to Linda Kuehl's work. But here's the twist: Linda had trouble actually turning the interviews into a book that captured Billie's true voice. She never wrote the book. Then she died in her 30s under mysterious circumstances. The DC police ruled it suicide but there's good reason to thik something else happened. So that's what the framing story is about. The people who were her potential enemies. We have contact with her family, and access to materials used in a doc about her and Billie, but I don't know if it'll be enough.

I'm glad it's not. --- Although, I could maybe imagine a way a guitar synth helps kind of reinvent what guitar does, and that's interesting if it could be pulled off in a non-dorky way. No Steve Vai shit, please.

Back in Telegraph Melts days, I fucked around a fair bit with "prepared" guitar. I had a whole bunch of metal things I'd put in the strings and so on. Some of it was pretty cool. I never got as proficient with it as I did with volume swells and scrapy shit, which was kinda my main idiomatic flourish at that point.

Within the small Pat Metheny love/hate society of some of us in the band, we call this the “dying dolphin” tone. It is etched into my mind from early exposure.

My interest is in using it more like a pedal board, I guess. But, like, where you can make certain notes do specific things under specific circumstances. In a way, I guess that’s a lot like a prepared instrument, right? Except, imagine if you were using a paper clip on the seventh fret of the fifth and third strings and only during the choruses of your song.

(Pat Metheny song is wrapping up. Man, this shit is so ingrained in my mind. The song “Au Lait” that follows it is one of my favorite PMG tunes. This is the iconic lineup represented by that Lego set.)

Hahahahhahaha. You’ve just read a whole email about songs and characteristics of early 80s Pat Metheny Group! I feel perversely proud of that.

I I might try the loud orchestra thing on one note. Right now I’m using software that lets audio input control midi output. The better systems use a special pickup. The difference is tracking. This software plugin’s tracking is imperfect. So it works best for ambient stuff. Might be kinda interesting to hear what one giant staccato note would sound like.

How are you doing recently? How’s stuff?

I’m having a ton of feelings (none of which are surprise) about the wave that crested at the capitol last week. 

Have been savoring Small Axe. Have the last one yet to watch. Watched The Godfather films again—had never seen the third part. Nowhere near as bad as I’d anticipated, but obviously flawed.</br></br>

<b> Jan 16, 2021, at 8:20 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> In case it's unclear, I was TOTALLY joking about the orchestra hits. Do you remember when that was so radical? Like, they're all over the song "The Unforgettable Fire." I don't hate them so much in that even though they're a terrible cliche. Maybe that's my version of being cool with Metheny's dying dolphin.

I'm a big fan of imperfections and limitations in music. You know, until I'm not, and then it's annoying. But I think there's something useful in having the shitty version of gear.

I just woke up from a nap. I'm not a big napper but sometimes you gotta nap. Today was one of those times. I don't know why. Maybe... everything in the world? Yeah, probably that.

For four years I basically didn't read the news. Now I can't get enough. I think it's entirely schadenfreude. I want to see Trump and everyone associated burn. I want them all in prison or worse. Also, I had this weird thing happen -- a guy I once mentored for my screenwriting program was outed as a major Qanon blogger. He was operating under a pseudonym. When someone sent me the article ("Qanon Blogger Revealed to be Failed Hollywood Screenwriter") I knew exactly who it was before I read the piece. Dude is an arrogant dipshit. Polite enough, but always ALWAYS sure he's the smartest guy in the room. His script was dogshit. And he was sure he could polish it up and sell it before the end of the year for six figures so he could buy Christmas presents. For real, that's what he asked me. He was booksmart but had no common sense. I was like: Man, even if you were good at this, that screenplay market you're imagining was a relic of the early 90s and it's long gone. It's like he read about this time that a bunch of people sold million dollar high-concept screenplays and assumed he could get in on the gold rush. He just didn't bother to check whether it was ongoing. He got banned from the screenwriting program's FB group for suggesting an alt-right discussion group. He went on to publish a 600-page book about Qanon and his blog is full of absurd pompous shit, peppered with calls to violence. I dearly hope the FBI is paying him a visit. And his parents, in whose NJ basement he lives, no kidding.

Haven't watched the rest of Small Axe though it's on the list. Last night we watched PRINCESS MONONOKE, which was great. I still favor SPIRITED AWAY by a mile, but I basically like any Studio Ghibli. You know, I remember seeing GODFATHER 3 and thinking it was way better than people said. I'm really interested in this new cut, which sounds like a good idea. Man, I love the first two.

This week was a struggle. Just dumb shit, I think. The world, plus being stuck in a phase of having to rewrite doomed projects, plus nothing happening with Legion since London is on lockdown again. We're also contemplating what it would look like to have another kid. I like the idea on paper. The reality is daunting as fuck. Many, many ripples. 

I have a project I've been struggling to find a way into for years and years. I had the thought that maybe you'd be a good person to help me, if you're willing. I don't know what the outcome would be. But essentially I've looked for ways to tell my HIV+ story in some way that captures both the weird almost mystical aspect of the experience and but so also is maybe somehow funny, in a farcical way. Because it's so fundamentally maudlin but I don't want to inflict that on anyone. I thought maybe you could interview me. Just ongoing interview questions to get the damn thing down in written form. No need to sweat the comedy-of-errors delivery at this point, that could come later. But I think you know the many sides of it already and the many sides of me inside it. So maybe that would lead to something. Dunno. Think it over.

Also also also I am GOING to get my friend Jeff to fucking help me get that ad written for a programmer to extract the text from those emails. I swear. I think I have to draft it for him, even tough I don't know what I'm asking for, then get him to correct it.

What is the word there? What does Fuzzy like to watch? We watched that fireplace loop on Netflix. I think Alison thought it was cozy. Me, I was annoyed.

</b> <br><br> Hilarious about the orchestra hits. I did not get that you were joking. But the thing is, I didn’t put together what you were describing as orchestra hits, which of course is exactly what you were describing. In my mind I was starting to design the patch that would produce the orchestral thunder. Each instrument would’ve had its own channel strip. It would’ve been massive. I was going to do all kinds of processing to make it sound at least plausibly authentic. This would’ve taken hours. I’d have triggered the patch with the E at the first string’s 12th fret. I’d have played a chromatic scale from low E. And when I finally got to the note…BAM! Only then would I have realized that I’d recreated one of the most ridiculous tropes of 80s pop. 

So thank you for telling me that you were joking.

Hey, I saw that thing you posted on IG—the dream about the high school friend and then reading about him in the NYT the next morning. That kind of synchronicity happens to me with what seems likes increasing regularity. Especially since the world has necessarily quieted down during the pandemic. I don’t know what to make of it. I’m a natural skeptic, but sometimes the idea that those things are coincidences strains my credulity more than thinking of them as meaningful does.

Last March I had a vivid dream about a former coworker from Pleasants. This guy was a marginal character, may have spent time in prison, may have been intermittently homeless. He was friendly-ish, but also kind of menacing and creepy in a sexual way. He scared some of the young women who worked at the store. I worked closely with him. I didn’t hate the guy, but I didn’t like him, and I definitely didn’t trust him. Mostly he seemed like a fog of manic sadness. So anyway, I hadn’t thought of him since the store closed years ago, and one night last year I had a vivid dream about him. The next morning, my friend Holly and I were about 20 minutes into a long walk, and the guy—Tom—passed a few feet in front of us walking north on Meadow as we were about to cross it on Park. I got full-body goosebumps along with a real weird sensation of uncanniness. That kind of thing seems to happen a few times per year.

That’s too much about the QAnon screenwriter. Sheesh. 

As far as current events go…I can’t bring myself to describe to you the level at which I am absorbed in this mess since the election. I have been apoplectic with both rage and fear. If I let loose and started typing all the stuff that’s going through my mind about it, I’d be up all night. At relatively calm moments I feel such awful sorrow by what (and who) has been lost. I have been seriously 
asking myself how I would want to manage spiritually in the midst of a chaotic, Northern Ireland or regional civil war scenario. Basically: Fuck.

Spirited Away reminded me of being on mescaline, but not necessarily on a good day.

Man, of course I want to help with your HIV+ story in any way that I can. I am jumping at that chance. I am thinking of questions.

Another kid?! Holy smokes! Please say more.

My life feels pretty small these days—in a comforting way. I’m making progress in learning how to be genuinely alone, which is something I explicitly set out to do in June. A few months after stopping drinking I began to understand other ways I’ve diverted my attention from stuff inside that might improve if I could face it. Thus the intense therapy stuff of recent months. But also, like, I’m not engaging in relationships that feel like distractions from something. I dunno. Seems like the right track.</br></br>

And it's so weird and funny, and then stunningly beautiful. The train ride across the water just slays me. I read a New Yorker profile that talked about the Miyazake museum outside of Tokyo. It has all these scale miniatures of things from his movies. I guess the windows on those things had metal covering them or something, but on opening day he saw kids trying to peel it back to look inside, and he joined them in peeling it back. Like he realized part of the childish joy was getting to look inside. I love that.

I've never done mescaline. But I like knowing that it might be like weird bad dark Miyazake. Now I will never do mescaline.

The weed experiment continues sporadically. I bought this beginner vape thing and I just realized a) it might be the wrong blend for the effect I want, and b) it contains a hundred hits. So I gotta live with it for a while. But I'm not sure it's gonna be for me. Once I approach "high," it really messes with my sense of time and my attention span. Those are pretty shaky with me already so I dunno.

As I've said, I like the idea of having HAD two kids. I'm definitely wary of HAVING two kids. And logistically it's just nightmarish to consider in this house. Also financially, given the shakiness of my job field. And so on. But the window is closing so we're considering it. I'm not sure I want to be in the position of having even less time for things, though. We'll see.

I'd forgotten that you stopped drinking. So how're ya now? I really like the state of mind after like 2.5 drinks, so that's kind of my issue. Honest to God, for like 20 years I've felt like that's the zone where I'm at my best. Two glasses of wine, just starting a third. But it's really easy to overdo it. 

We've been making a lot of baby dancing / twerking videos. He'll twerk to anything. But what I really like is that I"ve shown him most of the sonically nifty objects around the house. So he really likes how our glass coffee table goes "BONNNNGGGG" if you slap it. Stuff like that. I'm hoping he'll just naturally grow up to be Harry Partch or Einsturzende Neubauten.

</b> <br><br> Drinking: I’ve enjoyed moderate to heavy boozing for most of my adult life. I haven’t been addicted in any clinical sense. Used to check in with my mental health people from time to time, and they didn’t seem worried about it. During all of my drinking time I was so grateful for alcohol's presence. It never caused me or my relationships any real harm, and I don’t regret any of it. I always felt bad for people who couldn’t avail themselves of alcohol. Their lives frankly felt…I dunno…puritan and severe. I used to dread having some real reason to stop. 

But over the year before I did stop, I kept having this experience of suffocation and numbness in my arms as I was falling asleep. The first time it happened I told friends but otherwise ignored it. The second time it happened I got an EKG—normal. The doctor gave me a bit of a tongue lashing along the lines of, “You honestly thought you were going to die and didn’t call 911? Next time call 911 you moron!”

After it happened a couple more times, I reluctantly decided to try not drinking. That was in May.  And there’s been this huge surprise for me which is that sobriety has its own, independent value.  Drinking has always had value for me, but sobriety has a different value. I never imagined that. I thought quitting would be an unmitigated loss. But mostly what I experience is the positive value of no longer drinking. I’m pretty sure it’s one of the conditions that has allowed me to stop avoiding some of the shit I’ve always worked so hard to not think about.

Anyhoo. Now that I reread all that I worry that it sounds like some kind of virtue bragging or proselytizing which I totally do not intend. Mostly because I don’t think sobriety is more virtuous than benefitting from booze. It’s just different and good in its own way. 

Weed:  Have you had experiences where you definitely enjoyed it / felt better or whatever? Like to the same extent that 2.5 glasses of wine is so good? I never have. My friends who use it regularly report feeling “light” and “happy” and “able to concentrate.” I gave up on it. Always made me feel like my lips were sewn shut with leather twine. Keep me posted. I find this topic super interesting.

Mescaline: Some people cultivate totally legal desert plants (available online) which, with a minimum of preparation, provide significant psychedelic journeys. These people do this 2-3 times per year. They report that the experiences invariably have a spiritually enriching…and credibly uplifting…effect on their lives. They say it’s not something one feels like doing often. And that it’s not casual in that one needs a full day without external responsibility to do it. But otherwise some people advocate it in practically an evangelistic way.

Cocaine: I’m on a roll on the topic of inebriants. I’ve never tried cocaine and have zero interest in it. In my mind it instantly makes a person into one of the guys from those Nick Kroll “Rich Dicks” sketches. I only bring it up because the other day I heard that when they have to depict cocaine use in the movies they use powdered vitamin B12.

<b> Jan 27, 2021, at 8:41 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> ﻿I could go on about all this but I’m just gonna send you a reasonably short take on film structure. It’s by a guy who writes under the pseudonym Film Crit Hulk. It started as a gag, so you’ll have to excuse the ALL CAPS. But this is genuinely pretty incisive. Most people tell you films use three-act structure. Except the midpoint is this big turning point in the middle of the second act. So that makes it four act structure? The best take I’ve found is that films generally use five-act structure. In fact, Tarantino often puts cards up with chapter numbers for all five acts. Watch INGLORIOUS BASTERDS for example. But so here is Film Crit Hulk’s breakdown of that.


FACT: WHILE SHAKESPEARE’S PLAYS WERE NOT OFFICIALLY WRITTEN WITH ACT DESIGNATIONS, HE DID TALK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIS VIEW OF ESSENTIAL STORYTELLING. AND WHEN HIS WORKS WERE LATER PRESERVED THEY WERE ALL BROKEN UP INTO 5 ACTS AND STUDIED EXTENSIVELY AS TO THE PURPOSE OF HOW HIS STORIES WORKED. AND IN DOING THAT, WE IDENTIFIED ALL THE BRILLIANT WAYS THAT SHAKESPEARE (AGAIN, THE GREATEST STORYTELLING GENIUS OF ALL TIME) USED STRUCTURE TO MAKE IT WORK.  

FOR SAKE OF EXPLANATION, HULK WILL USE MOST SHAKESPEARE’S MOST POPULAR PLAY, ROMEO AND JULIET AS AN EXAMPLE- “audible grooooooooan!” HEY, IT’S A SNEAKY GOOD PLAY THAT’S WAY MORE SATIRICAL THAN PEOPLE REALIZE! AND FAR MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS HIS BEST KNOWN PLAY SO IT HELPS VASTLY WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING.  

SO SHAKESPEARE’S 1ST ACTS WERE ALWAYS COMPRISED OF INTRODUCTIONS AND THE ESTABLISHING OF A PREEXISTING CENTRAL MAIN CONFLICT (I.E. TWO FAMILIES ARE AT ODDS, ROMEO IS A LOVESICK PUP OVER ROSALINE, JULIET IS A NAIVE AND LOVELORN GIRL). NOW, HULK TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, BUT THIS PREEXISTING CONFLICT IN THE BACKGROUND IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CREATES A CONDITIONAL WORLD FOR THE AUDIENCE WHO IS ENTERING IT. SHAKESPEARE DIDN’T HAVE CINEMA’S NEAT TRICKS OF LANDSCAPE SHOTS AND VOICEOVER PROLOGUES. SO HE STARTED US IMMEDIATELY IN THE STORY AND IT WAS AN AMAZING WAY OF CREATING A SENSE OF SPACE, HISTORY, AND BELIEVABILITY. AND IT’S A BIG SURPRISE TO HULK HOW OFTEN THIS PRACTICE IS IGNORED IN BLOCKBUSTER FILMMAKING. AND HECK, EVEN IF IT IS SOME INTRICATE HUMAN DRAMA OR SOMETHING, A PREEXISTING CONFLICT COULD DO SO MUCH.
MOSTLY BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A GREAT SITUATION TO SPUR THE MAIN CONFLICT INTO EFFECT! 

AND THAT’S BECAUSE THE 2ND ACT IS USUALLY COMPRISED OF SOME KIND OF CENTRAL EVENT THAT CHALLENGES OR DEEPLY WORSENS THE MAIN CONFLICT. IT’S USUALLY IN THE FORM OF RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT, A FIGHT, A REVEAL, OR A SURPRISE (I.E. STAR-CROSSED TEENAGERS ROMEO AND JULIET MEET AND GO GA-GA OVER ONE ANOTHER, WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE PREEXISTING CONFLICT OF THEIR FAMILIES’ FEUD). BASICALLY THIS ACT FEATURES THE MAIN SURFACE PLOT OF THE STORY COMING INTO EFFECT. MEANING IF YOU HAD TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT, THE CONFLICT BEING CREATED IN THE 2ND ACT COULD EASILY DESCRIBE THE MAIN CONFLICT OF THE ENTIRE FILM, I.E. “TWO STAR CROSSED LOVERS FALL IN LOVE WHILE THEIR FAMILIES ARE AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER.” AND HOWEVER THIS CONFLICT IS REVEALED, IT SHOULD BE DONE IN WHICHEVER WAY WOULD BENEFIT THE STORY MOST. 

THEN THE 3RD ACT COMPRISES A TURNING POINT. NOW, HULK REMINDS YOU THAT THIS NEED NOT BE A “TWIST” PER SE, BUT MORE OF A SPURRING INCIDENT OR ACTION THAT MAKES THE CONFLICT INFINITELY MORE COMPLICATED (I.E. MERCUTIO GETTING KILLED BY TYBALT THEN ROMEO KILLING TYBALT). OFTEN THESE MOMENTS ARE SURPRISING. THEY DEEPLY AFFECT NOT ONLY THE LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS OF MAIN CONFLICT, BUT DRAMATICALLY ALTER THE ACTUAL DIRECTION OF IT. THIS IS THE SORT OF THING ALLUDED TO IN THE “RISE IN CONFLICT” STATEMENT, BUT YOU KNOW, WAY MORE SPECIFIC. IT REQUIRES THAT YOU THINK INTENSELY ABOUT THE NATURE OF YOUR CONFLICT: WHY DOES IT EXIST? WHAT IS PERPETRATING IT? WHAT WOULD MAKE IT WORSE? AND HAVE THE STORY RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. AND THE SHAKESPEAREAN 3RD ACT IS SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN STORYTELLING BECAUSE: 

IT’S A WAY TO HIT THE AUDIENCE WITH CLIMAX-LIKE DRAMA BEFORE THEY’RE READY FOR IT. BEFORE THEY EXPECT IT. AND IT’S NOT MERE “GOTCHA” TACTICS. IF DONE RIGHT, YOU CAN CREATE THE KIND OF EMOTION TO CARRY YOU RIGHT THROUGH TO THE END. 

SHAKESPEARE’S 3RD ACTS WERE OFTEN FILLED THEM WITH SUCH MOMENTS OF STORYTELLING BEAUTY: GREAT INVERSIONS OF FORTUNE. BEST INTENTIONS GONE AWRY. DEATHS! LOSS! CONFUSION! SUDDEN CHAOS! EVEN THOUGH THESE 3RD ACTS DON’T FINISH THE ARC OF THE WHOLE STORY, THEY ARE OFTEN THE MOST RESONANT MOMENTS AND THEY ARE STILL CLIMAX-WORTHY IN SCALE.  

WHAT DOES HOLLYWOOD TEND TO DO IN THEIR BIG ADVENTURES? THEY HAVE “2ND ACT PROBLEMS,” THAT’S WHAT THEY DO. THEY SAY “HEY, LET’S PUT AN ACTION SCENE HERE!” OR SPIN THEIR WHEELS AND LOSE ALL SENSE OF PURPOSE, OFTEN SAVING WHAT COULD HAPPEN NOW FOR SOME INEVITABLE 3RD ACT OBLIGATORY CONCLUSION. THEY FUCK UP THE MIDDLE OF THEIR STORYTELLING. MEANWHILE THE SHAKESPEAREAN 3RD ACT IS PERFECT. IT MAKES FOR A “TURNING POINT” THAT IS BOTH DEEPLY AFFECTING AND PROVIDES CHANGE TO THE ARC OF THE ENTIRE STORY. AND IT IS SOMETHING FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT 3-ACT-STRUCTURE ARGUES IS JUST PUTTING THINGS IN PLACE FOR CLIMAX. SPEAKING OF WHICH… 

THE 4TH ACT OF SHAKESPEARE’S MODEL WAS KNOWN AS “THE SPIRAL” AND IT IS ACTUALLY FULL OF CHARACTER DECISIONS THAT CAUSE CHARACTERS TO SINK TOWARD THE REAL CLIMAX (I.E. ROMEO AND JULIET DECIDE GO ON THE LAM, HATCH A PLAN TO FAKE THEIR DEATHS, ETC). THESE DECISIONS ARE RAPID. FAST-PACED. POORLY CONCEIVED. AND HUGELY DRAMATIC. IN TRUTH, THIS IS THE POINT WHERE YOU ARE REALLY ARRANGING AND SETTING UP THE CLIMAX. 

BUT IN THAT GOAL IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY TRUE TO THE CHARACTER ARCS AND FLAWS, OTHERWISE IT WILL FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE FLYING OFF THE RAILS INSTEAD OF SIMPLY GETTING MORE INTENSE. AND THIS FEVERISH, INTENSE CLIMATE IS THE BEST PLACE TO EXPOSE THE DEEP CHARACTER FLAWS THAT WILL EITHER BRING DOWN OUR HEROES OR ALLOW THEM TO SUCCEED. (MEANWHILE, THE SHAKESPEAREAN 3RD ACT TURNING POINT CAN SOMETIMES ALLOW FOR A MAIN CHARACTER ACTING OUT OF CHARACTER. IT’S A NEAT LITTLE DISTINCTION TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT A CHARACTER WOULD DO IN A SITUATION VERSUS WHAT THEY DIDN’T DO).  

THE SHAKESPEAREAN 4TH ACT ALSO PROVIDES A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR A QUIET MOMENT OF REFLECTION BEFORE THE FINALE, BEFORE THEY MAKE THE KINDS OF GRAVE DECISIONS THAT SEAL THEIR FATE. BUT IT CAN’T JUST BE ALL REFLECTION AND PAUSING (COUGH COUGH GREEN LANTERN). AGAIN, IT SHOULD REALLY FEEL FULL OF DECISIONS. THE PACE SHOULD QUICKEN. THINGS SHOULD FEEL LIKE THEY ARE FALLING OUT OF CONTROL FOR OUR CHARACTER. IT IS “THE SPIRAL,” AFTER ALL. AND IT SHOULD FEEL LIKE IT’S ALL HAPPENING IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE WE GET TO… 

THE 5TH ACT IS WHERE THE AUDIENCE GETS THE CLIMAX / RESOLUTIONS / WEDDINGS / TRAGEDY / FALLOUT/ ETC. (I.E. ROMEO AND JULIET HAVE A FATAL MISCOMMUNICATION, KILL THEMSELVES, AND LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES TO BE HEARTBROKEN AND DECLARE PEACE). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS LAST ACT IS NOT JUST WRAPPING THINGS UP, BUT IS THE ENCAPSULATION OF THE STORY AND SHOULD EXHIBIT ALL THE POINTS ONE IS TRYING MAKE IN YOUR MOVIE. AS HULK SAID EARLIER, THE ENDING IS THE CONCEIT SO THE CLIMAX AND RESOLUTION ARE THE VERY GOAL OF YOUR MOVIE. WHILE SHAKESPEARE WOULD HAVE A CHARACTER TALK DIRECTLY TO THE AUDIENCE AND SUM UP THE LESSONS THEY SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THE STORY, HULK GETS WHY THAT SAME METHODOLOGY MIGHT NOT FLY IN SCREENPLAY FORM. BUT SCREW IT, MODERN WRITERS ARE SO DREADFULLY AFRAID TO BE DIDACTIC THAT THEY FORGET TO INCORPORATE THEIR PURPOSE AND INTENT IN THEIR ENDINGS. THEY OPT FOR ALLEVIATION OR OBFUSCATION. MOST OF THEM COULD DO WITH A FAIR BIT OF DIRECT MORALIZING. HECK, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN ENDS WITH THE SHAKESPEAREAN SOLILOQUY TO THE AUDIENCE, SO YOU SHOULD BE LESS AFRAID OF IT TOO. NO MATTER WHAT, YOUR ENDING SHOULD BE THE SUMMATION OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WRITTEN SO FAR. IT SHOULD NOT BE A FREAKIN’ AFTERTHOUGHT. 

NO MATTER WHAT THE STORY - TRAGEDY, COMEDY, OR HISTORY - SHAKESPEARE’S PLAYS WERE IMBUED WITH THIS SPECIFIC 5 ACT STRUCTURE EVERY TIME. THE INTRO, THE ESTABLISHING OF THE CONCEIT, THE TURN, THE SPIRAL, AND THE CLIMAX (WHICH HAMMERS HOME THE CONCEIT). SURE, HE GETS HEAPED WITH PRAISE OVER HIS MASTERY OF LANGUAGE AND THE DEEP RESONANCE OF THEMES, SOME JUSTIFIABLY CREDIT HIM AS THE FATHER OF PSYCHOLOGY, BUT HULK WANTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT HE WAS JUST SO FUCKING BRILLIANT AT STORY STRUCTURE TO BOOT… IT’S SORT OF UNFAIR. AND HULK KNOWS IT MAY SEEM LAME BRING UP SUCH AN OBVIOUS CHOICE AS “BEST WRITER EVER” BUT, WELL, HE WAS. 

BUT WHILE HULK CLEARLY ADORES THE WAY THAT SHAKESPEARE’S 5 ACT STRUCTURE CAN HELP YOU UNLEARN 3 ACT STRUCTURE, CHIEFLY IN HOW IT GIVES IMPORT AND MEANING TO “THE MIDDLE” OF STORYTELLING, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS SHAKESPEAREAN 5 ACT MODEL IS JUST ANOTHER POSSIBLE EXAMPLE AND NOT THE RULE. YOU CAN HONESTLY DO WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF ACT BREAKS. IT’S WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOUR STORY, LIKE THE USE OF 9 ACTS IN MALCOLM X. BUT HEY, IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A TOOL TO HELP BETTER STRUCTURE YOUR STORY, OR IF YOU ARE A STUDENT LOOKING TO GET BETTER AND LEARN HOW TO WRITE WITH PURPOSE AND INTENT… WELL… ONE COULD DO A LOT WORSE THAN THAT SHAKESPEARE GUY.

<b> Feb 25, 2021, at 2:32 PM / Tim McCready <takethefirstleft@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Shit’s kind of interesting? 

1. Details of my past continue to come into focus. I dunno. I guess I wasn’t ready before. Sobriety, mindfulness practice, and weirdly—doing therapy by phone all seem like important factors. Although I’d thought of myself as being able to say anything to Jean and mostly could, it turns out that there were certain things I couldn’t say to her face-to-face. So it’s going well. It’s super weird, but it’s genuinely helping make sense of a bunch of stuff that used to always slip my grasp if I tried to focus on it. My sense that this shit is finite and leading to an actual improvement in my life continues to prevail.

2. The deadline for the next cycle of that grant from last year is open again. Deadline next week. I talked to one of the administrators, got helpful feedback, and am revising and re-submitting. I doubt they’re gonna support the project, but it’s not out of the question. They are definitely more about funding programs to teach poor kids to paint murals and whatnot. I don’t mean that to sound dismissive, it’s just more their thing.

3. I’ve made a big decision. I’m going back to vinyl. It’s been dawning on me that there is a clear opposite correlation between my interest in listening to music and the effortlessness of listening to it. Like, as technology has made everything accessible all the time, I’ve valued it less and less. That’s not to say that its value is in scarcity…it’s just that the rituals of actually doing a physical thing to cause music to play seem like they encourage me to really listen. Obviously I don’t have a budget to buy a bunch of records, but I figure I can buy a record a month, and if I genuinely focus on a record a month, I’m gonna be way, way ahead of the dead zone I’m in now. We’ll see. Sometimes schemes like this work, sometimes they don’t.

Oh, and my friend Jamie (who buys and sells records) brought me a starter package that made me feel seen. Steve Reich, Arvo Pärt, The Unforgettable Fire, Stan Getz, Big Star, etc.

4. I’ve been really focused on a super nerdy project in which I make lead sheets of my songs in the format of the Real Book. The Real Book has a very specific, very dorky aesthetic. This thing will have some (very, very modest) utility when the band gets back to practicing / recording. Mostly it’s a lark. See video.

How’s shit there?

<b> Mar 1, 2021, at 1:03 PM / Bob Massey <masseymail@gmail.com> / </b> <br><br> Sorry, been a little slammed. Before I forget, news you can use:
https://creative-capital.org/2021/02/23/artist-opportunities-with-upcoming-deadlines-in-march-and-april-2021/?mc_cid=fa3a31899c&mc_eid=40d24e1ad9
Just a list of various grants and residencies with deadlines coming up.

It is SO fascinating, this phenomenon of being able to say different things by different mediums, or whatever the word would be. I’ve thought about that in terms of art, how you can say things when you assume a persona that you couldn’t when you don’t. But I’ve never considered the way it works with therapy.

Dude, you are dead on with the vinyl thing. It’s all true. It becomes like Netflix, just overwhelming in the decision-making stage. So you don’t decide at all. 

When we first got a turntable here I went to Amoeba Records and just scoured the dollar bins. It was great! I bought all kinds of things I never would have spent bigger money on. Lots of “guilty pleasure” stuff (which is just “pleasure”). But some records I used to have but sold when I moved west. Now I buy maybe a few records a year but I love them all. And it’s literally more fun to play. And I enjoy the artifact itself. I support this.

This book thing is gonzo and hilarious. You should sell them in editions of three, each priced at like $220,000.

Shit here’s fine. Alison’s on set for three days so I’m Mr. Mom. Ewan’s at daycare all day though, so that makes it easier. Also, long story, but the guy above her at the company got the boot, so she’s the boss now. Running the company. The Pres. It’s pretty crazy to me. Nine years she’s been working in Hollywood and now she’s running the company of this famous actor. And it won’t stop there, I guarantee. But in the short term, it’s great because the guy who got fired isn’t a bad dude but he would ice her out of a lot of stuff and make it difficult for her to be in the loop. He’s very smart but a bully to creatives. Jim and Todd finally just reached the limit. I mean, they’re princes and their company is called That’s Wonderful! with the exclamation point, and people were coming to them saying Eric has to go. Like, the studio execs and their agents and everyone. But all those people love Alison, so it’s gonna be a new day.

She hung out in a yard with Cate and her sister and our friend Taylor and when Alison told them she said, like, “Can you even believe it?” And in unison they all go: YES. She does have that CEO personality.</br></br>

BRUTAL.

Notes on the statement:

“…moved to Richmond at that time. I had some early success, with records released on tastemaker labels and [laudatory reviews in NME, whatever]. I would have loved to continue that creative arc, but disabling mental illness…”

“…album I hope can mark a new start to my belated career.” 

“Through the long medically-assisted recovery process, I’ve found that my songwriting…” [NOTE: “medically-assisted” may not be the right phrasing but I wanted to indicate that the process was formal, not, you know, smoking a bunch of weed and watching Golden Girls.]

While I too have used “weirdos” in an affirmative sense, being one myself, some people bristle at the idea, so you might consider “creatives” or somesuch.

Otherwise I fucking love this. It’s great. Truly.</br></br>

</b> <br><br> That’s incredible news about Alison! Congratulations to her. But, maybe “incredible” is the wrong word in light of the plain truth of Cate’s and her sister’s response.

I remember that Eric fella.

Thanks for the Creative Capital link. I’ve come to believe that until I make this record I don’t have a basis for applying for all this stuff. But I’m definitely studying these listings and dreaming. Speaking of grants and the record, I’ve attached my amended artist statement for this CultureWorks thing in case you’re interested. After talking to them, it felt like I should say less and in a more relaxed way. Apparently, they had no idea I was a geezer and seemed to find that especially compelling. I’m starting to wrap my head around raising the money. Brainstorming, making lists, and so on. I’m feeling good about it—hopeful. At some point soon I feel like I’ll need to check in with Chad. I hope the plan we talked about a year ago is still doable, once everyone’s vaccinated and whatnot. But I’m not taking anything for granted. A lot can change in a year under much better circumstances than these. Do you have thoughts about this?

Vinyl: I ordered my first record. Eitzel’s most recent, Hey Mr. Ferryman. I was sold by the first song, which I previewed on Spotify. It includes a line to the effect of, “I spent the last 10 years trying to waste half an hour.” I’ve been on a kick of listening to his stuff that I’d not checked out before. Am realizing that when I like him, I really love him. And when I don’t like him, I think he sounds like The Smithereens. Also: Despite how (relatively) successful those records he made with Peter Buck were, man…Peter Buck did not bring much to the table. So much less interesting.</br></br>

On “weirdos” — when I spontaneously said that to the administrator on the phone she laughed hard and it was the moment we connected. Otherwise, totally agree.

Thanks again.</br></br>

The Red Hand Files

ISSUE #138 / MARCH 2021

I read the Mark Mordue biography 'Boy On Fire' recently. I'm always interested in people's stories and often ponder how and why some people's voices get to be heard whereas others don't. Mark's writing touched on this with Bronwyn Bonney's quote about a formula of success that you had, unlike some of your creative friends in those early years. Do you reflect on this at all?PAULA, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIAI want to do music and I love it so much. It means everything to me but I worry that I don't have any talent. How important is talent?STELLA, AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND
Dear Paula and Stella,
 
In Melbourne, in the late seventies, there was a beautiful blossoming of creativity, and the music scene was awash with talented people. Brilliant musicians, some of them extraordinarily accomplished, were everywhere. You couldn’t walk through St Kilda or Carlton waving a stick without hitting a talented musician. I was one of those talented people — I just wasn’t that talented. I couldn’t play an instrument as well as most other musicians, I was a less than capable singer, and my songwriting was in no way as strong as that of some of my contemporaries. I was acutely aware of these shortcomings, and felt set apart from that world.

Having said that, I was also aware that there was a force at work inside of me that other musicians didn’t seem to possess, at least not to the same degree. This also set me apart, and caused me no end of trouble. I had, without any supporting evidence, a shameless and pathological belief in my own awesomeness. Whilst many other musicians’ dreams seem to stretch to getting a gig at the local pub on a Saturday night, my dream was always, always, world domination. You have to remember that this is coming from a guy who when asked by his primary school teacher what he wanted to be when he grew up, answered, ‘A cult leader.’

Now this may sound unattractive, and it was, but that’s what my youthfulness was like — an energetic and aspirational collision of the beautiful and the deeply unpleasant, with an emphasis on the latter. As a young person I harnessed the unredeemed aspects of my personality — rage, vengeance, power, self-absorption, rampant ambition — to provide the energy to move beyond my lack of aptitude. 

This furious motion kept me running wild through the years, until I finally collided with myself, I guess, and things changed. But that’s another story. This is just to say to you both — any competency I display now, such as the ability to write, record or perform songs, came about through repetition and practise and a bloody-minded pursuit of my own particular vision. Nothing came naturally. I worked at it.

Art gives much, but it asks much in return. It demands nothing less than complete commitment and significant sacrifice. Talent is nice if you have it, but in some ways it is a secondary requirement. Warren Ellis once said,  ‘Proceed with absolute confidence,’ and, Stella, that is my advice to you. Find your authentic voice and push violently and defiantly against your limitations — and you never know, great things may happen. I hope they do.
 
Love, Nick

But our culture certainly feeds into certain delusions. I have a long practice of writing down potential song titles and lyrics and one I keep coming back to is, “Losing is everything.” It’s where character comes from, certainly — with our former POTUS and his focus on winning being an extreme example of the opposite belief. I’ve never been able to distinguish “calling” from ego or entitlement in myself, but I think once you’ve fallen down enough, it strips away some of the worst practices of ego. And, perversely, once you’ve succeeded enough I think the same thing happens if you’re self aware, as the thing you dreamed of is found not to hold the meaning you ascribed to it. I’m interested in the ones who keep trying without overly romantic delusions to prop them up.</br></br>

But maybe we should agree on what we want to keep from the email threads. I say lose all quote levels, keep the thread in chron order.
